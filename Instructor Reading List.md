Where to start
This is a possible sequence of readings to get you, the instructor, familiar with the topics discussed in the open course “Social Justice and Data.” It is a reshuffling of the readings that led to the course’s creation, arranged in a way that (hopefully) makes sense.
This is followed by some options for further reading, arranged by broad category, that I found interesting and/or valuable as I planned the course.
Unless otherwise indicated, all resources are openly accessible.
These zines, published by Allied Media Projects, provide accessible introductions to data and data-adjacent topics with a focus on social justice. AMP is a Detroit-based network of individuals and projects and is a leading organization when it comes to design justice.

The Feminist Data Manifest-No is a “set of declarations and commitments for feminist data studies,” which offers an excellent way in to the principles that underlie this course’s approach to data. It also serves as an introduction to a more academic approach to data justice.
Feminist Data Manifest-No (2019), drafted under the leadership of Marika Cifor and Patricia Garcia.
This article introduces the data literacy framework that is at the core of this course, developed by D’Ignazio and Bhargava and implemented through their Data Culture Project collection of resources. (An earlier version of their framework was presented in 2015 at the WebScience Conference in Oxford.)

These next three articles represent further work and developments by D’Ignazio and Bhargava, and serve as a bridge between the data literacy framework presented above and the book Data Feminism.

Data Feminism serves as the text for this course. The lesson plan is intended to allow students the opportunity to work hands-on with data (to address the suite of skills outlined in our framework for data literacy) while the text is intended to get students thinking about data in context: both the context of a particular dataset but also the context for data as a concept.
Data Feminism (2020) by Catherine D’Ignazio Lauren F. Klein.
Loukissas’ book is a bit too technical to use for course readings but I felt I really benefited in having been exposed to his point of view. He’s approaching the topic from a much different point of view than any of our other authors and provides some deeper examinations of topics the course touches on more lightly.
All Data Are Local: Thinking Critically in a Data-Driven Society (2019) by Yanni Alexander Loukissas.
This is the only non-OA source I feel strongly enough about to recommend reading. Hall and Dávila are design faculty (among other things) and dive deeply into the assumptions that underlie a lot of data-related arguments (not just visualizations). I didn’t find Chapters V and VI too useful, though, and you’d probably be okay leaving them out.
