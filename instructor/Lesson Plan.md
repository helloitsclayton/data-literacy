# Social Justice and Data Lesson Plan

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This lesson plan is structured as an 8-week course, meeting for 90 minutes twice a week.
>
> It was developed as a two-credit course at an institution where 16 credits per semester is the expected course load for students.

## Week 1

### Class 1 - Course introduction

- Opening activity - ["Paper Spreadsheet"](https://databasic.io/en/culture/paper-spreadsheet) from the Data Culture Project. Have students fill this out as they come into class.
- Go over the course's syllabus and the LMS page for the course.
- Return to "Paper Spreadsheet" for discussion outlined in activity.
- Introduce a few datasets we may be working with regularly?
- At the end of class, assign the "background info" questionnaire via course page, intended to help me learn more about the class' interest/needs, "due" by next class.
- Assigned readings (for next class):
   - [The Myth of Objective Data](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-myth-of-objective-data/) by Fienberg (2023)
- Assigned readings (to complete by Class 4):
   - *Data Feminism* [Introduction](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/frfa9szd/release/6)
   - *Data Feminism* [Chapter 1](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/vi8obxh7/release/4)

### Class 2 - Defining data

- Readings to be completed ahead of class:
   - ["The Myth of Objective Data"](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-myth-of-objective-data/) by Feinberg
- Introduce "Daily Data Discussions," taking 5 minutes or so at the start of each class for us to offer examples of how data has come up in our lives â€“ be sure to have your own example to kick things off!
- **Discussion:** [Feinberg & data](#c02-discussion-feinberg--data)
- Lecture: Raw Data // Raw Carrots
- Data vs. Statistics vs. Visualizations

> I was surprised by how difficult students found Kidd's article. I think the Inuit maps offer a great example of a "nontraditional" data gathering process that resulted in actual systemic change, but one that relied on a specific context. Other, similar projects have not been as successful.
- **Discussion:** [Counter-mapping](#c12-discussion-counter-mapping)
## Week 7

### Class 13 - Final reflection peer review

- Assignments due:
   - Final reflection draft
- Activity: Peer review of final reflection
   - This form will take you through the peer review process for each paper you're reviewing. Broadly, there are two topics on which you'll be providing comments:  
Process - how previous assignments and in-class work affected the formulation of their research question and how they might go about investigating it.  
Data & Data Science - how their relationship with data, data science, and data-related research may have changed based on topics we've covered.
   - Topic 1: Process  
This paper should discuss the process involved in the first two assignments, how the Data Biography assignment and in-class activities affected the question chosen by the author for their Research Inquiry assignment.  
It should also discuss the effects of these factors on how they thought about investigating their chosen question.
      1. What did you find most effective, interesting, or insightful about the description of their process?
      2. What aspects of their process could've been described more clearly or effectively? Is there anything you think they should've discussed in more detail, or anything you wish they had been more clear about?
   - Topic 2: Data & Data Science  
This paper should also discuss how the topics covered in this class have (or have not) fit into the author's existing idea of data and data science. It should also speak to how the author's approach to data-related research may have changed based on the topics covered in class.
      1. What did you find most effective, interesting, or insightful about the author's description of their relationship with data, data science, and/or data-related research?
      2. What aspects of their relationship with data, data science, and/or data-related research could've been described more clearly or effectively? Is there anything you think they should've discussed in more detail, or anything you wish they had been more clear about?
   - Final thoughts  
Please provide any final thoughts or comments you might have for the author:

### Class 14 - Speaking for data

- Readings:
   - *Data Feminism* [Chapter 6](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/czq9dfs5/release/3)
   - ["On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922) by Bender et al.; skip section **2. Background**
- Discussion: AI and data
- **Activity:** [Speaking with statistics](#c14-activity-speaking-with-statistics)
- Brief discussion: Visualizations from Yanni Alexander Loukissas' *The Life and Death of Data*
   - Visualization #1: http://www.lifeanddeathofdata.org/appendix/calendar_linear.html
   - Visualization #2: http://www.lifeanddeathofdata.org/appendix/calendar_radial.html
   - Visualization #3: http://www.lifeanddeathofdata.org/appendix/polarmap_time.html
   - *For context*:
      - Example accessions data tag: https://lifeanddeathofdata.org/media/figure6_l.jpg
      - Data tag diagram: https://lifeanddeathofdata.org/media/figure6_s.jpg
      - Arnold Arboretum grounds map: https://arboretum.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ArnArb-Master-Grid-Map.pdf
   - Loukissas was specifically interested in foregrounding the fact that visualization represent a *dataset* and not the real world that the dataset is intended to represent.

## Week 8

### Class 15

- Readings:
   - *Data Feminism* [Chapter 7](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/0vgzaln4/release/3)
- Activity: [Write a Data Storybook](https://databasic.io/en/culture/storybook)
> [!NOTE]
> For this activity I pulled the following variables from the 2022 [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/): sex, sexnow1, sexornt, age, cappun, gunlaw, abany, abdefect, abnomore, abhlth, abpoor, abrape, absingle
>
> I gave the students the raw data as well as tables summarizing responses by sex, by sexual orientation, and by age.

### Class 16

Finish up final presentations, end-of-class discussion and debrief

# Activities & discussions

## C02 Discussion: Feinberg & Data
1. How did you feel about Feinberg's discussion of data?
2. How does her characterization of data agree or disagree with your understanding of data?

[Return to Class 2](#class-2---defining-data)

## C03 Activity: Describing the CILS dataset

This activity is intended to provide students with an example of the types of questions they should have in mind, and the investigative process which they could use, when it comes to their Data Biography assignment. Be sure to let students know that they shouldn't be thinking about the two research article readings just yet, but they'll be involved in the next discussion.

Arrange students into small groups and provide them with the following prompt and list of questions:

---

Answer the following as best you can, using the information in the CILS reading and from the [CILS website](https://cmd.princeton.edu/publications/data-archives/cils):

1. **Who** - Who was responsible for the creation of the CILS dataset?
2. **What** - What types of data were collected in the study? What variables? What subjects did the study focus on?
3. **When** - When were the data collected?
4. **Where** - Where were the individuals being studied located? Where were the researchers located? Where did data collection take place?
5. **Why** - Why were the data gathered? What is the purpose of the study?
6. **How** - How were individuals selected for the study? How were data gathered?

[Return to Class 3](#class-3---data-biographies)

## C03 Discussion: Use of the CILS data  
1. Do the research articles ("Feeling Unsafe..." by Maffini and "Educational Pathway..." by Dunn) provide any reasoning for working with CILS data?
2. Do the research articles discuss any of the data's limitations and what impact that has on the conclusions drawn? (This is usually in a Discussion or Conclusion section.)
3. Based on your understanding of why the CILS data was gathered (question 5 in the earlier group discussion), how well do the research questions examined by Maffini and Dunn match up with the original purpose of the data?
4. Can you think of any other reasons the research articles used the CILS dataset? Why didn't Maffini or Dunn produce their own data?

[Return to Class 3](#class-3---data-biographies)

## C04 Discussion: Systems of power and CILS data

This discussion asks groups to apply concepts learned from *Data Feminism* Ch. 1, from the *Data Materiality* podcast episode, and from the preceding lecture on data settings and assemblages, to the CILS data we worked with in Class 3.

Ask the groups to respond to the following:

1. First, consider just the CILS study itself. Based on *Data Feminism* Ch. 1, what power imbalances can you identify? How might they have affected the resulting dataset?
2. Building on your work in Class 3, expand your description of the CILS data to try and capture the *data assemblage* that supported creation of the CILS dataset.
3. How might you characterize the *setting* of the CILS data, as described in our podcast episode reading?
4. Can you identify any power imbalances that may come up when considering the *reuse* of the CILS data by other researchers like Maffini or Dunn, also discussed in Class 3?

[Return to Class 4](#class-4---data-power-context)

## C05 Activity: ["Asking Good Questions"](https://databasic.io/en/culture/ask-questions) with [WTFcsv](https://databasic.io/en/wtfcsv/)

The activity as described in [the handout](https://databasic.io/en/wtfcsv/wtfcsv-activity-guide.pdf) is very easily adapted to other contexts. I use it more or less as-is, but have all of the students (in small groups) interrogate the same dataset. I also prepared an Ohio version of the UFO data to serve as an "inspirational example."

- Example dataset: [Ohio UFO sightings CSV](https://github.com/helloitsclayton/data-syllabus/blob/main/Students/Class-05/C05-Ohio-UFO.csv)
- For student evaluation: [selected variables from Ohio incidents](https://github.com/helloitsclayton/data-syllabus/blob/main/Students/Class-05/C05-Mapping-Police-Violence.csv) appearing in the [MappingPoliceViolence.org](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) dataset

> [!NOTE]
> The full MappingPoliceViolence.org dataset can be downloaded [here](https://airtable.com/shroOenW19l1m3w0H). Using OpenRefine, I retained only the following columns as variables: age, gender, race, date, city, county, cause_of_death, circumstances. I then filtered to only incidents in Ohio and only up to December of the previous year.
>
> Interestingly, the Ohio data includes two identical entries in "circumstances" which keeps WTFcsv from displaying that variable as a word cloud. I initially left this to possibly spark some conversation. I also slightly edited one of those entries in OpenRefine and prepared [a second dataset](https://github.com/helloitsclayton/data-syllabus/blob/main/Students/Class-05/C05-Mapping-Police-Violence-2.csv) for which the word cloud functions as intended.

[Return to Class 5](#class-5---asking-questions-with-data)

## C06 Activity: Civic Data Field Guides

Packaging info about their chosen data set for peers?

Materials needed:

- Large sheets of white paper
- Standard size markers/colored pencils/crayons
- Scissors

[Return to Class 6](#class-6---challenging-power)

## C07 Activity: ["Sketch a Story"](https://databasic.io/en/culture/sketch-a-story) with [WordCounter](https://databasic.io/en/wordcounter/)

Materials needed:

- Large sheets of white paper
- Poster or other large markers

Though it may not appear so on the surface, the [built-in activity](https://databasic.io/en/wordcounter/wordcounter-activity-guide.pdf) is actually flexible enough to apply to this context. I just (again) had all of the groups work on the same dataset. This also means that comparing how different groups reacted to the same dataset can be a part of the de-brief.

- Have students read the brief intro on the [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/) site
- Give students some time to explore the [redlining map](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/map), and be sure to direct their attention to the forms that provide the text they'll be evaluating. This can be done by clicking on a specific area and then switching from the "MAP" tab to the "SCAN" tab.
- For student evaluation: [HOLC Area Descriptions for Ohio](https://github.com/helloitsclayton/data-syllabus/blob/main/Students/Class-07/C07-HOLC-Area-Descriptions.txt) from Mapping Inequality

> [!NOTE]
> Area descriptions are downloadable on the [American Panorama GitHub](https://github.com/americanpanorama/HOLC_Area_Description_Data) via the file `ad_data.json`. I then used OpenRefine to filter to just the entries from Ohio. Because I knew I'd be combined several variables worth of text into a single file (removing the context of column headers) I used OpenRefine to remove entries that just read "None" or something similar. Its "Cluster and edit..." feature is very useful for this.
>
> I exported the resulting data table as a CSV file, and used a spreadsheet editor to copy the text from the following variables into a plain text file: clarifying_remarks, favorable_influences, detrimental_influences. Finally, I did some minimal "cleaning" of the plain text files, mostly just fixing a few character encoding errors.
>
> Usefully, OpenRefine should automatically hang onto your data table; it'll be used in an activity next week.

[Return to Class 7](#class-7---maps-text-and-arguments)

## C08 Activity: Planning data cleaning  

In this activity, groups will consider how they might go about "cleaning" the data in the Mapping Police Violence dataset, which we looked at in [Class 5](#c05-activity-asking-good-questions-with-wtfcsv). It will take groups through common choice points in the cleaning process, and ask them to decide how they might handle each issue.

Provide groups with the following prompt and list of questions:

The first step in most data analysis processes is to "clean" the data so that the process can be more easily automated. For this activity, you'll be looking at the [Mapping Police Violence dataset](https://airtable.com/shroOenW19l1m3w0H) and considering how you might go about this:
1. Scroll left in the dataset to get a sense for the number of variables (i.e., the number of columns). A description of the different variables can be found in the data documentation. If you were downloading this data set for your own purposes, would you be interested in all of the variables? Which variables might you leave out (and why)?
2. The layout makes it pretty obvious when an individual piece of data is missing, like the "age" of the person in row 9 or the "race" of the person in row 25. What might you do with these gaps? (Also, you can have a different approach depending on the variable/column)
3. There are a few different geographic variables in the dataset, some with a lot of variation in how they're recorded (like "street_address"). If you wanted to associate each data point/incident/row with a single more uniform geographic variable, what might you do?
4. What would you do with the "circumstances" variable/column, which contains plain-text descriptions of the incidents pulled from news reports? Would you keep it as-is, try to reduce it down in some way (maybe come up with categories like for the other variables?), leave the variable out altogether, or something else?
5. BONUS/food for thought: What do you do with data points with more than one thing in them, like "agency_responsible" in row 14?

[Return to Class 8](#class-8---positionality-and-data)

## C09 Activity: [SameDiff activity](https://databasic.io/en/samediff/) from [DataBasic.io](https://databasic.io/en/)

Materials needed:

- Large sheets of white paper
- Poster or other large markers

The [built-in activity](https://databasic.io/en/samediff/samediff-activity-guide.pdf) is not really adaptable in this case. Instead, using the SameDiff tool, I asked groups to compare text data for HOLC area descriptions graded "A" with those graded "D". As with the [Class 7 activity](#c07-activity-sketch-a-story-with-wordcounter), the end goal was for groups to sketch a story that they identify when the two text data files are compared with each other.

- [Ohio HOLC Area Descriptions - Grade A](https://github.com/helloitsclayton/data-syllabus/blob/main/Students/Class-09/C09-HOLC-AD-A.txt)
- [Ohio HOLC Area Descriptions - Grade D](https://github.com/helloitsclayton/data-syllabus/blob/main/Students/Class-09/C09-HOLC-AD-D.txt)
> [!NOTE]
> I couldn't figure out a way to make the [built-in activity](https://databasic.io/en/samediff/samediff-activity-guide.pdf) work with a suitably interesting dataset, so My version of this activity builds on using WordCounter with HOLC Area Descriptions from Mapping Inequality in Week 4.
>
> Again using OpenRefine, with the same file as in Week 4, I filtered State to Ohio and then used the Grade variable to export all of the "A" descriptions and all of the "D" descriptions as two separate files.
>
> As in the WordCounter activity, I copied the text for the variables: clarifying_remarks, favorable_influences, detrimental_influences, into two different plain text files.

[Return to Class 9](#class-9---revisiting-text-data)

## C10 Activity: Census questionnaires

Either print out or otherwise provide for students the questionnaires from the [2000](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2000/technical-documentation/questionnaires/united-states/d61a.pdf), [2010](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2010/technical-documentation/questionnaires-and-instructions/questionnaires/2010_questionnaire_info.pdf), and [2020](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/technical-documentation/questionnaires-and-instructions/questionnaires/2020-informational-questionnaire-english_DI-Q1.pdf) U.S. Census. Give groups some time to familarize themselves with the documents, and then ask them to respond to the following:

1. Based on these questionnaires, what would you say that the U.S. government considers important data to collect through the census?
2. A key argument of the podcast episode "reading" for today is that what *does not* get counted *does not* count. What are some things the census questionnaires don't ask about? What data isn't "worth" collecting, according to these questionnaires?
3. What about the Census questionnaire has stayed the same since 2000? What has changed?

[Return to Class 10](#class-10---what-gets-counted)

## C12 Discussion: Counter-mapping

1. What connections can you draw between Ch. 5 and counter-mapping as described in Kidd's article?
2. Between Kidd's article and other topics we've covered? (Power, What gets counted, etc.)
3. I probably needed to be more explicit in how I saw the two readings connecting, e.g., working from the margins and collective action.

[Return to Class 12](#class-12---working-collectively)

## C14 Activity: Speaking with statistics

For this activity, ask groups to read this [Fox News article](https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-prison-data-blows-up-narrative-that-low-level-drug-offenders-are-filling-up-u-s-prisons-experts), which makes the argument that drug-related convictions are not that serious of an issue. It specifically states that:  
> "Data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) show only 12.6% of state prisoners are behind bars for drug-related crimes and only 3.2% are locked up on possession charges â€“ while five times as many people are in state prisons for violent crimes rather than drug charges."

The article links to [a statistical report from the BJS](https://bjs.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh236/files/media/document/p21st.pdf) to back up their claim.

Have groups download the above BJS report, and ask them to respond to the following:

1. Can you find where in the linked report they pull those two statistics from? (Give a page or table number.)
2. What other statistics contained in the report support or contradict the Fox News article's argument? (Look at tables near the one where they got their statistics)
3. Do you agree with Fox News' argument? What other information might you want/need before making your own conclusion?

## Assignment 1: Dataset Biography

A short paper (2-3 pages) introducing a selected dataset and discussing how it came into existence. Please include a link to the dataset - a properly formatted citation in your chosen style would be best - as part of the paper.

As the name implies, you're writing a (concise) biography of that dataset. A good place to start is with the Five Ws: Who, What, When, Where, and Why. Feel free to throw How into the mix as well!

Be warned, though, many datasets won't just tell you the answers to those questions. In fact, sometimes that information might never have been recorded in the first place. For our purposes, then, I want you to comment on any major gaps you notice.

Below are three very different approaches that you can consider:
- ["Data Biographies: Getting to Know Your Data" by Heather Krause](https://gijn.org/2017/03/27/data-biographies-getting-to-know-your-data/)  
A journalistic approach, one that makes sense if you're looking at someone else's dataset
- ["Datasheets for Datasets" by Gebru et al., in *Communications of the ACM*](https://doi.org/10.1145/3458723)  
Extremely detailed and technical, probably most useful if you generated the dataset
- [*Data User Guides* from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center](https://github.com/rgradeck/Data-User-Guides/blob/master/README.md)  
Also intended for self-generated data, but less technical and more open-ended

## Assignment 2: Research Inquiry

A short paper (2-3 pages) which presents and discusses a research question that has grown out of your examination of a selected dataset. The question should be a reaction to the trends, gaps, or other aspects of the dataset. Think back to our in-class activity where you came up with questions about the Charlotte, NC Traffic Stops dataset. That, along with other in-class data storytelling activities, should be good examples of the process for coming up with a research question.

The paper itself should discuss how the question was inspired by the dataset (i.e., what was it in the dataset that led you to ask this question?) along with which aspects of your question are covered by your dataset. You should also discuss what other datasets might be required and where might you find that information. What other resources could or should be incorporated (books, articles, etc.)?

A few hopefully reassuring notes:

1. You won't actually be undertaking this research during the class, so you don't need to worry about over-promising or giving yourself too much work by asking a really exciting (but complicated) question.
2. The dataset you use for this assignment does not have to be the same one you used for the Data Biography assignment. If you do choose a new dataset, though, I'd encourage you to at least think through those biographical questions before starting with this assignment.

## Assignment 3: Draft Presentation & Reflection

A short paper (4-5 pages) reflecting on the research process as well as a draft slide deck or script (or anything else that could be considered a presentation draft). See the Final Presentation & Reflection assignment description for full details on what these should cover and how they should fit together.

What I expect in this draft is a 4-5 page paper that your classmates and I can provide feedback on (we will be doing some peer reviewing) along with a draft slide deck/script/outline/etc. showing how you have thought about creating your final presentation. **You will not be giving a "draft" presentation at this time.**

## Assignment 4: Final Presentation & Reflection

A short paper (4-5 pages) reflecting on the research process as well as a 5-minute presentation which will be given the last two days of class. The reflection should be a longer version of what you will cover in your presentation. 5 minutes is less than you think, so the paper is an opportunity to discuss the topics in your presentation at greater length and in greater detail.

This assignment should address the process that you have gone through in the first two assignments, as well as what steps you would take in order to investigate the question proposed in your Research Inquiry assignment. How did the Data Biography or our in-class activities affect your research question? How might they affect the way you'd plan to investigate that question?

I am also interested in hearing how the topics we've covered in class have (or have not) fit into your existing idea of what data and data science are. Will it change how you approach data-related research in the future, either research you do or research you read about? If so, how?

I'm not expecting anything specific in terms of the format of the presentation. A slide deck seems like a reasonable starting point but is not required. It should be able to stand on its own as a coherent expression of the work you've done (meaning we should be able to understand it without having to read the paper), and the Reflection should provide me with additional insight and detail regarding what you've talked about in the presentation.

Your submission here should be the paper along with any supporting materials (slides, etc.) from your presentation.

# Materials, misc. links, etc.

I used this tool to randomize students and assign small groups and peer reviewing: https://www.randomlists.com/team-generator

I bought an array of crayola markers, crayons, and colored pencils to use with the various art-forward activities. Students seemed to respond very well to this and enjoyed the process (though many were nervous about their art skills).

I used 18" x 24" white drawing paper for everything but the Dear Data activity, which I bought from an art supplies store (along with the drawing materials above).

From the same store I bought blank postcards for Dear Data, though I realized after a student pointed it out that the "standard" (4"x6") postcards I bought were much smaller than the ones used in the project. Theirs were around 5.5"x8.5", so half of a standard letter-sized paper might work better.
