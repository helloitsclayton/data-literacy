# Instructor Materials

## Reading List

[`Instructor-Reading-List.md`](https://github.com/helloitsclayton/data-literacy/blob/main/instructor/Instructor-Reading-List.md) is intended to orient a new instructor to the theoretical underpinnings of this course. It includes:
- A sequential collection of "core" readings with annotations (all but one of which are OA)
- A collection of additional readings around different relevant topics (most, but not all, of which are OA)

In addition to the core sequence of readings, I strongly advise reading all of the required readings for the course. There is very little overlap (only *Data Feminism*), and the assigned readings were just as essential to my understanding as they are to the students'.

## Lesson Plan

[`Lesson-Plan.md`](https://github.com/helloitsclayton/data-literacy/blob/main/instructor/Lesson-Plan.md) is a day-by-day, annotated lesson plan for an 8-week course that meets for two 1.5 hour classes per week. Each class includes one or more of the following:
- Readings and assignments due
- Lectures (with linked slides)
- Guided discussions with sample questions
- Guided activities with specific instruction

It also includes a description of the course's assignments in a separate section, though I may pull this into the `student/` folder.

## Lecture slides

The folder `slides/` includes a folder for each lecture included in `Lesson Plan.md`. To present using directly from the existing HTML files, you can download the entire `slides/` directory as-is, navigate to the relevant folder, and open `index.html` in your browser of choice.

Slide decks are are formatted as HTML files using an open source Javascript library called [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js). More information on reveal.js is provided in a README file in the `slides/` folder, along with some basic information on customizing the content and appearance of the slides.

## Bibliography

[`bibliography.md`](https://github.com/helloitsclayton/data-literacy/blob/main/instructor/bibliography.md) is (as the name implies) a full bibliography for the course. I've chosen to arrange items into broad categories, so there is a tiny bit of overlap when items fit into multiple categories. I intend to also maintain a [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5508994/datalitcourse/library) which allows you to view all items at once.
