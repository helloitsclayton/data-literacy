# Instructor Materials

## Reading List

[`Instructor Reading List.md`](https://github.com/helloitsclayton/data-literacy/blob/main/instructor/Instructor-Reading-List.md) is intended to orient a new instructor to the theoretical underpinnings of this course. It includes:
- A sequential collection of "core" readings with annotations (all but one of which are OA)
- A collection of additional readings around different relevant topics (most, but not all, of which are OA)

## Lesson Plan

[`Lesson Plan.md`](https://github.com/helloitsclayton/data-literacy/blob/main/instructor/Lesson-Plan.md) is a day-by-day, annotated lesson plan for an 8-week course that meets for two 1.5 hour classes per week. Each class includes one or more of the following:
- Readings and assignments due
- Lectures (with linked slides)
- Guided discussions with sample questions
- Guided activities with specific instruction

It also includes a description of the course's assignments in a separate section, though I may pull this into the `student` folder.

## Lecture slides

The folder `slides` includes a folder for each lecture included in `Lesson Plan.md`. These are formatted as HTML files using an open source Javascript library called `reveal.js`. More information is provided in a README file in the `slides` folder.

The folder `slides` also contains the `reveal` and `css` folders, both of which support the formatting of the slide decks but do not affect the content of the slides themselves. `reveal` is pulled directly from the [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) repository and I try not to mess with it (aside from tossing out files not used). I've mostly put together the files in `css` myself, so feel free to adjust as you see fit.
