**Catalog Description**
- Becoming "data conversant" is only growing in importance as data-related practice becomes increasingly ingrained in public and academic discourse. Learning data-related skills, like reading, working with, analyzing, and arguing with data, is often viewed as a purely technical process that centers mastery of coding or data analysis software.  
Instead, this course will take a justice-centered approach to data: Students will gain practical experience through low-tech explorations of real-world data, but we won't shy away from or gloss over data's inherent complexities. And data are complex, just like the people who are responsible for their creation, curation, and use.  
To help us navigate these murky waters, and to move past number crunching to deeper critical analysis, we'll be drawing on the expertise of scholars, practitioners, and enthusiasts from an array of disciplines and backgrounds.  
There are no prerequisites for this course.

**Check the learning goals which are central to this course:**
- [ ] Use information technology and make use of the information they find
- [ ] Students acquire knowledge and understanding of fine arts, humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences.

**How might this course serve majors in other disciplines?**
- This course offers a low-barrier option for humanities majors to begin "getting their feet wet" with data studies, and to broaden their view of what studying data might look like. The course content includes several examples of work in the humanities that leverages data in creative or transformative ways.  
This course uses criticality as a strategy for approaching data studies and examines data as a social construct. This provides students in the social sciences with an opportunity for applying existing familiarity with these (or similar) concepts in a new and exciting context. It also focuses specifically on data and datasets relevant to a wide array of social science disciplines.  
For science majors, this course could be the only time that they are introduced to the idea of the social constructed nature of data. Though they may be more familiar with statistics, it's likely that they've only ever approached data studies from a more "technical" viewpoint. Equipping them with the tools to critically evaluate data is essential to produce the well-rounded students that data studies desperately needs.

**Does the course subject matter or the readings overlap significantly with courses in other departments?**
- No

**What is the enrollment limit for this course?**
- 12

**What pedagogical principles, facilities or equipment availability, or other factors justify the enrollment limit placed upon this course?**
- This course relies heavily on the interaction between instructor and students and the monitoring of small group work. Many of the in-class activities are very open-ended and there is a danger of groups becoming sidetracked or spinning their wheels, and so being able to intervene is essential to running the course successfully.

**Is the subject matter of this course in your area of study and expertise? If not, what work has prepared you to teach the course?**
- I have Master's degrees in Mathematics and Library and Information Science, providing me with significant experience in quantitative reasoning and in the critical evaluation of information sources. As Kenyon's Data Services Librarian, and in previous roles, I have worked with a wide array of data and resources.  
In Fall semester 2023 I taught this course as a special topics class and received excellent feedback from students, and have been encouraged by several to teach the class again. As part of my preparation for that special topics course, I did extensive reading and research on data literacy. This included a review of literature on approaches to teaching data literacy as well as critical data studies.

**I have consulted with the library liaison for my department/program.**
- Yes

**Are library holdings, computer resources and other facilities sufficient to support this course, or are startup improvements needed?**
- Existing library holdings, computer resources, and other facilities are sufficient to support this course.

**Should this course fulfill the Quantitative Reasoning requirement?**
- No

**Might the topic of the course serve one or more of the interdisciplinary programs?**
- Yes

**List them.**
- Computing
- IPHS (Integrated Program in Humane Studies)

**Have you contacted the relevant directors?**
- No

## Feedback

The Curricular Policy Committee asked for more clarification regarding the "justice-centered approach" (mentioned in the course description) before approving the proposal.

My response:  
> My use of the phrase "justice-centered approach" is drawn from Data Feminism, one of the primary sources of readings for the course. The authors reframe the concept of "data ethics" as "data justice" (table 2.1 on p. 60), arguing that "ethics" replicates existing power structures by individualizing problems in people or technologies. "Justice" is used instead to recognize inequities in structural power and to foreground the need for examining systems of power along with the datasets that they produce. The course aims to impart students with practical skills alongside considerations of how systems of power affect data and are affected by data. That second part, the examination of data through the lens of systems of oppression and power, is what I meant by a "justice-centered approach."
>
> The first assignment, the Data Biography, offers a good example of how this approach functions in practice. Alongside asking students for a basic reading of a dataset (types of variables, populations, etc.) it asks students to examine who is responsible for the dataset's creation. This ties into broader concepts of "data settings" as described by Yanni Loukissas Alexander in All Data Are Local and "data assemblages" as described by Rob Kitchin in Data Revolution. I hope to expand on these ties in future iterations of the course.

# Special Topics course proposal

**Department:**
- INDS (interdisciplinary studies)

**Course title:**
- Data and Social Justice

**Course Level** (All Special Topic Courses are _91):
- 100

**Semester:**
- Fall 2023

**Enrollment Limit:**
- 12

**Course Description** (Include the prerequisites or a notice of no prerequisites):
- We are more aware than ever how enmeshed data is in our everyday lives. But just being aware of the ubiquity of data doesn't mean we're automatically able to read, analyze, and argue with data. These skills that are only growing in importance as data-related practices become increasingly ingrained in academic and public discourse. Becoming "data conversant" is often thought of as a purely technical process: learning to code or using a particular app or software. Aside from placing unnecessary barriers in the way of learners, that technical approach fails to engage with the complexities surrounding the creation and use of data. And data are complex, just like the people responsible for their creation, curation, and use. In this course we will dive headfirst into low-tech explorations of real-world data while confronting data's inherent complexities. Helping us to navigate these murky waters and to move past number crunching into deeper critical analysis will be the work of scholars and practitioners from an array of disciplines and backgrounds.  
There are no prerequisites for this course.

**Does this course carry a .50 Credit?**
- No

**Explain half credit:**
- This course will bear a 0.25 credit because it will only meet during the first 8 weeks of the semester.

**Do all parts of this course take place on Kenyon's Campus?**
- Yes

**Is this course taught by a Kenyon professor?**
- No

**Explain professor choice:**
- The course will be taught by a librarian with a Master's degree in Library and Information Science and experience as sole instructor for undergraduate and graduate courses.

**Grade Mode:**
- Letter grade

**Is this course taught entirely during the times slotted by the Registrar's Office according to the official college calendar?**
- Yes

**Has this course been taught before as a special topics? If so, which semester?**
- No.

**Description of the Assignments**  
*Give a brief description of each required assignment, including the type of assignment (e.g. research paper, group presentation, exam, etc.) and the approximate paper length or scale of the assignment. If participation counts for a significant portion of the grade, summarize the expectations for participation*:  
- A significant portion of the learning in this course will rely on in-class, hands-on activities which the students will complete in small groups. Students will also engage in small group discussions regarding readings. These will be incorporated into a classroom participation grade.
- The course's primary assignment will be a final presentation which is scaffolded throughout the course: Students will identify data relevant to their own lives and/or communities, formulate a research question based on examination of their data, and craft presentations reflecting on their work and on possible future avenues of inquiry.
- Data biography: short paper (2-3 pages) introducing a dataset and discussing how it came into existence. Students will seek to answer questions such as who is responsible for its creation and what its original intended purpose was.
- Research inquiry: short paper (2-3 pages) discussing a research question that has grown out of examination of their selected dataset. What other data might be needed to address this question? What other resources would you incorporate (books, articles, etc.)? Why is this question important to you?
- Presentation draft/reflection: short paper (4-5 pages) reflecting on the research process and preparing for the final presentation. Students will have engaged in small group peer reviewing and reflection to aid in this process.

**Weighting of the Assignments** (in points or percentages):  
- Participation: 40%
- Data biography: 5%
- Research inquiry: 10%
- Presentation draft/reflection: 10%
- Final presentation: 35%

**Timing of the Assignments**  
*Give either the week (e.g. week 4, week 11, etc.) of the 15 week semester that each assignment is due or the approximate due date*:
- Data biography: Wk 3
- Research inquiry: Wk 5
- Presentation draft/reflection: Wk 7
- Final presentation: Finals week

**Is another department or program also likely to teach something like this special topic-- subject matter, readings, etc...? If so, with whom have you consulted to make sure that we aren't duplicating content?**
- Though other departments/programs include content related to data, data literacy as a set of competencies (reading, working with, analyzing, and arguing with data) is not a topic of any course in and of itself. This course avoids duplicating content in IPHS, Scientific Computing, and Statistics as it does not approach data literacy through a framework of statistical software or coding, opting instead for low-tech and low-barrier activities paired with examinations of the contextual nature of data creation, curation, and use.

**Why is this course being listed as a Special Topic?** (complete all that apply)
- [X] This course will be worked into the permanent curriculum if the instructor and the department are satisfied with this first offering.
- [ ] This course has not been taught in at least seven years, was dropped from the permanent curriculum, and the department missed the deadline for permanent adoption.
- [ ] The instructor is a visiting faculty member and will not be at Kenyon to offer the course again.

**Explain why having the instructor teach a special topic is preferable to offering an existing course in the permanent curriculum.**
- This course is being offered as a pilot, with the intention of submitting as a permanent course in the future.

**Are library holdings, computer resources, and other facilities sufficient to support this course? If not, explain what start-up improvements are needed.**
- Existing library holdings, computer resources, and other facilities are sufficient to support this course.

## Feedback

Feedback from the Curricular Policy Committee noted the heavy weighting towards participation. I chose to reduce the Participation weight from 40% to 35%, and increased the weighting of the Data Biography assignment to 10%.

It was also pointed out that the final presentation should be scheduled during or near Week 8 and not during Finals Week as listed in the submission. This was just an oversight on my part.

## Background info

> [!NOTE]
> I attached the following to my course proposal as a PDF, though I have no idea if or how it affected decisionmaking.

Much of my background reading has pointed me away from approaching data literacy, which Catherine D'Ignazio and Rahul Bhargava define as "the ability to read, work with, analyze and argue with data as part of a larger inquiry process," through overly-technical or code-based instruction. Instead, I plan to focus on low-tech, hands-on activities (e.g., [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject), [Data Culture Project](https://databasic.io/en/culture/)) alongside examinations of the contextual/situated nature of data. Some texts I plan to use for readings are [*Data Feminism*](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein, [*All Data are Local*](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/11543.001.0001) by Yanni Alexander Loukissas, and [*The Data Journalism Handbook*](https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv1qr6smr) by Liliana Bounegru and Jonathan Gray.

Students will learn:
1. What data is and what data types are common; how data does (and does not) represent aspects of the world
2. That knowledge is situated, and how this can (and should) be applied in the context of data
3. The acquisition, "cleaning," and managing of data from various sources
4. The analysis and evaluation of obtained data, and how this leads into or contributes to the inquiry process
5. The use of data in support of larger narrative or message, which is crafted with a particular audience in mind

Finally, I want to say that the term "literacy" carries with it embedded meanings which can often connote power imbalances and serve as a barrier to learners. So even though this proposal is for a "data literacy" course, I want to avoid using that term in its promotion to students
