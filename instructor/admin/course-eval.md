# Student course evaluation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This was distributed as a Google form after the final day of class. Official College evaluations are not sent out until the end of the semester, leaving a large gap. It was also unclear if students would get an official evaluation form for this course, so I chose to include the "standard" questions (the first nine) that appear in the College's evaluation form.

All anonymous (or should be - let me know if not)
And don't worry about repeating things that were said during our final class! I took notes but they certainly weren't exhaustive.

Answer the following questions on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being "ineffective" and 5 being "highly effective."

In this course, the instructor...

1. Communicated effectively
2. Made effective use of class time
3. Helped to create a positive learning environment
4. Made the course material interesting
5. Treated me and my work with respect
6. Provided helpful and timely feedback on assignments
7. Was available to students outside of class hours
8. Was effective in teaching this course
9. Challenged me to go beyond my previous abilities

The hands-on activities I incorporated were meant to provide experience with reading, working with, analyzing, and arguing with data.  
**Compared to the beginning of the semester**, how would you rate your confidence in each of those areas?

1. Reading data - understanding what data is and what aspects of the world data represents
2. Working with data - acquiring, cleaning, and managing data
3. Analyzing data - filtering, sorting, aggregating, and comparing data
4. Arguing with data - using data to support a larger narrative

Please provide any additional comments about our hands-on activities and Reading, Working with, Analyzing, and Arguing with data:

What aspects of the course content or topics covered did you find most interesting? What do you expect will be most useful to you, either personally or professionally?

What aspects of the course content or topics covered did you find least interesting? Was there anything that felt out-of-place or like it could've been skipped over?

Is there anything you feel was missing from the course content? What things should be covered if/when this course runs again?

Please provide any feedback on the course's **textbook**, *Data Feminism* by D'Ignazio and Klein:

Please provide any feedback on the **other assigned readings**:

Please provide any feedback on the course's **assignments**:

Are there changes you'd suggest in how I describe the course? The name or course description?

Finally, any general feedback you might have, or anything you'd like to provide that didn't fit any of the previous categories:
