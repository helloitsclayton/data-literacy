## Fall 2024 semester

### Long description

Becoming "data conversant" is only growing in importance as data-related practice becomes increasingly ingrained in public and academic discourse. Learning data-related skills, like reading, working with, analyzing, and arguing with data, is often viewed as a purely technical process that centers mastery of coding or data analysis software.

Instead, this course will take a justice-centered approach to data: Students will gain practical experience through low-tech explorations of real-world data, but we won't shy away from or gloss over data's inherent complexities. And data *are* complex, just like the people who are responsible for their creation, curation, and use.

To help us navigate these murky waters, and to move past number crunching to deeper critical analysis, we'll be drawing on the expertise of scholars, practitioners, and enthusiasts from an array of disciplines and backgrounds.
There are no prerequisites for this course.

### Short description

How does social context affect the creation and use of data? And how is that context essential to a justice-centered approach to reading, understanding, and working with data? This 8-week course will use low-tech methods and real-world data to help answer those questions and more, no coding skills required.

## Fall 2023 semester

### Long description

It's no secret that data is enmeshed in our everyday lives, but just how enmeshed may come as a surprise. Even as we grow more accustomed to data being gathered about us, like location, purchasing, and social media interactions, data already affects our lives in ways as varied as the nutrition information on our food, the rates we pay for car insurance, even the design of the buildings we live and work in. Just being aware of the ubiquity of data doesn't mean we're automatically able to read, work with, analyze, and argue with data, skills that are only growing in importance as data-related practice becomes increasingly ingrained in public and academic discourse.

Becoming "data conversant" is often thought of as a purely technical process, whether it involves learning to code or becoming familiar with a particular app or software suite. Adopting that approach places unnecessary barriers in the way of learners and fails to engage with the complexities surrounding the creation and use of data, an essential component of the critical evaluation of data. And data are complex, just like the people who are responsible for their creation, curation, and use. So, while this course will see students diving headfirst into low-tech explorations of real-world data, we aren't going to shy away from or gloss over data's inherent complexities. Helping us to navigate these murky waters, and to move past number crunching to deeper critical analysis, will be scholars and practitioners from an array of disciplines and backgrounds.
There are no prerequisites for this course.
