						<aside class="notes">
							Probably a familiar example even if you haven't been to London, Beck's London Underground map set a trend that we're still following (as evidenced by the next slide)
							It intentionally abstracted space, location, etc. to make it easier to trace subway lines
							What sort of arguments does it make?

							Here's the current map for the Skytrain transit system in Bangkok, Thailand
							Follows a lot of the same conventions
							What arguments does it replicate from Beck's map?

							We've looked at the HOLC Redlining maps from Mapping Inequality before, an argument is very foregrounded here (that red is bad and green/blue are good)

							Similar map in appearance, but a less obvious argument. This is a Sanborn Fire Insurance Map from the Sanborn Map Company, published 1913
							Some arguments:
							<ul>
								<li>Land is parceled out in the manner indicated</li>
								<li>Private land ownership is a thing</li>
								<li>Nothing but buildings matter (for fire insurance)</li>
								<li>Footprint of buildings are as neat and tidy as depicted</li>

							This type of map might or might not be familiar.
							Clearly privileges highways (those signs are huge!)
							Do those lines (for roads or rivers) actually correspond to the width of the road or river? No way!
							City boundaries, do those exist? Only on the map.
							And look how connected everything is by highways! You should DRIVE EVERYWHERE

							This map looks terrible, clearly shows greater investment in highways
							The highway signs are still the most prominent things on these maps!

							This is a rather famous image from the Belgian satirical newsletter <em>Le Frondeur</em>, depicting Belgium, Germany, and Russia splitting up a pumpkin representing the Congo. Underneath the pumpkin -- a map!
							Maps were essential in establishing and maintaining colonial control of Africa and Asia by Western European colonial powers. Essentially, lines are drawn on a map and then ownership can be assigned.
							A point made by Kidd in an earlier section of her article is that the way settlers mapped North America, only including natural features, erased any sense of indiginous use of the land and presented it as empty and available.

						These are some of the land use maps that Kidd describes in her article on Inuit mapping, and were part of the case made for indiginous sovereignty over areas in Canada. Notably, this is from a report commissioned by a government agency, and as Kidd details it was motivated by the desire to get at oil in these territories.
