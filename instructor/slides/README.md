# Lecture slides

These slides have been created using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/), an open-source HTML presentation framework. Aside from being a tool that I'm familiar with, I felt this would work well as something easily sharable on GitHub. I've also included PDF versions of each.

To present using the existing HTML files, download the entire ``slides`` directory as-is, navigate to the relevant folder, and open ``index.html`` in your browser of choice. Pressing ``S`` on your keyboard with the presentation open will open a Speaker View window, with notes and a timer that should be familiar to users of PowerPoint or Google Slides.
