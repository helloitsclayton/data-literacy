						<h2>Large Language Models<br>(LLMs)</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Most AI is based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
							This is a VERY over-simplified version of how LLMs work
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="llmDiv">
							<img src="img/llm01.svg" />
							<div>
								<p>Ohio: $(1,5)$</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							LLMs take the basic building blocks of a language and associates each one with a vector
							Those of you that have taken a few math classes might be familiar with this
							For our purposes you don't need to know vectors, this example will keep things pretty basic
							Let's say in our example, the word Ohio is represented by the vector (1,5)
							We'd expect to see words related to 'Ohio' assigned vectors nearby this one
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="llmDiv">
							<img src="img/llm02.svg" />
							<div>
								<p>Ohio: $(1,5)$</p>
								<p>Columbus: $(1,6)$</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							For example, Columbus is the capital of Ohio, so we might expect it to be pretty close by since the words are related
							Let's say in our model, then, that Columbus gets assigned the vector (1,6)
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="llmDiv">
							<img src="img/llm03.svg" />
							<div>
								<p>Ohio: $(1,5)$</p>
								<p>Columbus: $(1,6)$</p>
								<p>Iowa: $(4,3)$</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							Iowa is also a state, and is nearby Ohio geographically, so again we'd expect them to be pretty close
							So let's say Iowa gets the vector (4,3)
							Here's where the math starts to come into play
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="llmDiv">
							<img src="img/llm03a.svg" />
							<div>
								<p>Ohio: $(1,5)$</p>
								<p>Columbus: $(1,6)$</p>
								<p>Iowa: $(4,3)$</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							Going from Ohio to Columbus is actually another vector! That vector goes up by 1
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="llmDiv">
							<img src="img/llm03b.svg" />
							<div>
								<p>Ohio: $(1,5)$</p>
								<p>Columbus: $(1,6)$</p>
								<p>Iowa: $(4,3)$</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							And if we tack that vector onto the end of Iowa, that's another vector!
							The way LLMs work, we'd expect that little vector that goes up by 1 to "mean" the same thing for Iowa as it did for Ohio
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="llmDiv">
							<img src="img/llm04.svg" />
							<div>
								<p>Ohio: $(1,5)$</p>
								<p>Columbus: $(1,6)$</p>
								<p>Iowa: $(4,3)$</p>
								<p>Des Moines: $(4,4)$</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							So that resulting vector, in our pretend LLM, would probably mean the capital of Iowa, Des Moines
							Like I said, this is a very simplified explanation; one of the issues that might be apparent is that there isn't a lot of "room" in two dimensions
						</aside>

				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<div class="llmDiv">
							<img src="img/llm05.svg" />
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							So then I guess we try three dimensions! Meaning our vectors get three coordinates
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="llmDiv">
							<img src="img/llm06.svg" />
							<div>
								<p>Ohio: $(1,5,5)$</p>
								<p>Columbus: $(1,6,6)$</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							It works the exact same, except now our little vector goes up one and over one from Ohio to Columbus
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="llmDiv">
							<img src="img/llm07.svg" />
							<div>
								<p>Ohio: $(1,5,5)$</p>
								<p>Columbus: $(1,6,6)$</p>
								<p>Iowa: $(4,3,1)$</p>
								<p>Des Moines: $(4,4,2)$</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							And just like before our little vector does the same thing to Iowa
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="llmDiv">
							<img src="img/llm08.svg" />
							<div>
								<p>Ohio: $(1,5,5)$</p>
								<p>Columbus: $(1,6,6)$</p>
								<p>Iowa: $(4,3,1)$</p>
								<p>Des Moines: $(4,4,2)$</p>
								<p>"state capital": $(0,1,1)$</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							So in our LLM, that little vector (0,1,1) would be associated with the concept of state capital
							But again, three dimensions isn't nearly enough to model and actual language
							Just think, what are some other thing associated with these words?
							Ohio is also the name of a river, for example, so "river" would also be near "Ohio"
							Columbus is a name, after Christopher Columbus, so "Christopher" would be nearby
							"Chris" would be nearby "Christopher", and Chris Columbus is a director and so all of his movies would be nearby him, etc. etc.

							Those vectors are assigned when the LLM is "trained" using examples of the language it's meant to model
							This comes in the form of a text corpus, basically just a lot of text written in whatever language
							This gets fed into an algorithm that assigns vectors to words and then adjusts them as it goes through more and more of the text

					<aside class="notes">
						The problem is that whatever text corpus gets used, it's the product of specific authors in a specific context
						The algorithm is the product of coders working in a specific context
						ALL of this is hidden from the the individual who is actually seeing the output of whatever AI tool this is for
						What's more, because the corpuses used are so large it's impossible to have any real idea of what's being fed into a LLM
						Bender et al., 2019, is another excellent article (that can be tough to get through) that specifically discusses the problem with assuming a bigger corpus is a better corpus
