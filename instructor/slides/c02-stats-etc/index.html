					<h1>Data v Stats etc.</h1>
				</section>
				<section>

						<h2>Data</h2>
						<p>Data is a result of the systematic collection and storing of information, usually in machine-readable format.</p>
						<p>Most data can be structured as a table (aka <em>tabular</em>), in rows and columns.</p>
						<p>Data is often classified as either <em>quantitative</em> (i.e., numerical) or <em>qualitative</em> (non-numerical)</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Ask students to think about the intro activity from Class 1 and classify each question (/variable) as quantitative or qualitative
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Data</h2>
						<p><em>Usually</em>, for tabular data:<br>Each columns represents a different variable<br>Each rows represents a different "thing" that the data is describing</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Here again the Class 1 activity is a good example, with each question being a variable and each student being described by the data
						</aside>
					</section>

						<h2>Statistics</h2>
						<p>Statistics are summaries of data produced using numerical methods/analysis</p>
						<p>Averages, maximums or minimums, frequency/counts</p>
						<p class="fragment">Standard deviation, standard error, quartiles, correlation</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Some statistics are pretty basic, some are very complicated and technical! These are all just ways of getting a sense of a dataset in one way or another
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Statistics &amp; Data</h2>
						<p>Doing any sort of analysis of data almost always requires quantitative data.</p>
						<p class="fragment">What does that mean for qualitative data?</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Important to point out that working with qualitative data almost always involves some sort of translation into quantitative data. For ex., mapping people's hometowns from Class 1 requires translating a place name into geographic coordinates
							This even applies to AI chatbots! They're trained using words and phrases translated into mathematical structures called vectors.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Visualizations, Charts, Graphs</h3>
						<p>Data <em>visualizations</em> are usually based on the elements of a dataset itself</p>
						<p>Charts/graphs are drawn from statistical summaries of data</p>
						<p class="fragment">"Data Visualization" is increasingly being used as a blanket term for both</p>
