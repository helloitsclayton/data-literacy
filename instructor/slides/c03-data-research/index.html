							Early visualizations borrowed aesthetic choices from existing "authoratative" forms, like legal documents and pictoral representations of landscapes
							(Font choice, muted colors, minimalism)
							These are some visualizations by William Playfair, an influential British economist who was one of the first to use visualizations to the extent that he did; top left is from 1822, bottom right is from 1801
							Upper right is a work by JMW Turner, from 1796, lower right is by David Roberts, published in the 1840s

							The Enlightenment idea that nature's bounty was endless and existed to be tamed and used by humankind  
							(Data is an endless resource to be "mined")
							"Letting nature speak for itself," a moral attitude which held that scientists should be as remote as possible when observing or measuring phenomena  
							("Letting data speak for itself," explored further in Data Feminism Chapter 6)
							Photography and other technologies developed in the 19th century produced "objective" truth as they were not limited by human subjectivity  
							(Data & statistics are objectively true, AI is infallible)
							The philosophy underpinning all of this is that absolute truth exists and can be measured, or that objective knowledge exists and can be arrived at through enough observation.
