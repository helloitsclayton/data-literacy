					<h1>Data Visualizations as Arguments</h1>

						These concepts come up in <em>Data Feminism</em> Chapter 3, which isn't due until next class, but I want to provide a bit of a foundation for this class's activities around data visualizations and arguments

						<h3>September jobs report</h3>
						<div class="graphDiv">
							<div class="graphCol">
								<p>The U.S. economy added 114,000 jobs in September.</p>
								<img src="img/graph1.svg" />
							</div>
							<div class="graphCol">
								<p>The unemployment rate fell to 7.8%.</p>
								<img src="img/graph2.svg" />

						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is an example taken directly from Chapter 3 of <em>Data Feminism</em>, from <em>The New York Times</em>, and is meant to show how the same data visualization can be used to support multiple points of view with just a bit of tweaking.
							The source given is the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it is related to a NYT article titled "Drop in Jobless Figure Gives Jolt to Race for President" that ran in the Business section, under Economy

						<h3>How a <span style="color:#405695;">democrat</span> might see things</h3>
						<div class="graphDiv">
							<div class="graphCol">
								<p>There have been 31 consecutive months of job growth.</p>
								<img src="img/graph1dem.svg" />
							</div>
							<div class="graphCol">
								<p>The rate has fallen more than 2 points since its recent peak.</p>
								<img src="img/graph2dem.svg" />
							</div>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							Democrats might highlight the recent trend in job growth, focusing specifically on private-sector growth, and they might note the significant drop in unemployment since 2010

						<h3>How a <span style="color:#B43030;">republican</span> might see things</h3>
						<div class="graphDiv">
							<div class="graphCol">
								<p>Job growth has been weak.</p>
								<img src="img/graph1rep.svg" />
							</div>
							<div class="graphCol">
								<p>The rate was above 8 percent for 43 months.</p>
								<img src="img/graph2rep.svg" />
							</div>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							Republicans wouldn't ignore the jobs deficit from before 2010, and might note the number of new jobs needed to keep pace with population growth (according to Paul Ryan, at least). They might also focus on the length of time that the unemployment rate spent above 8%.

							But what about the "neutral" version? What assumptions are being made here?
							The next two slides are larger versions of each graph that you can switch between as students think.
							Some examples that I came up with:
							<ul>
								<li>That number of jobs and unemployment rate are measurable quantities</li>
								<li>That these statistics have been correctly calculated from the gathered data</li>
								<li>That the gathered data accurately represents the true number of jobs or unemployment rate</li>
								<li>That the observed number of jobs and unemployment rate for the years presented are related to a Democrat president</li>
								<li>That number of jobs and unemployment rate are indicators of economic prosperity</li>
								<li>That more jobs and low unemployment = good</li>
								<li>The definition of "employment" used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics is the most relevant one</li>
								<li>That time flows from left to right</li>
