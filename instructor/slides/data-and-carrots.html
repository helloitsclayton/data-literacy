							My argument is that data is "raw" in the same way that these carrots are "raw"
							Looking back at the OED definitions, does anyone have any issues with me calling these carrots raw? Certainly they aren't cooked, but unprocessed?
							What about these baby carrots, or carrot sticks? [click to reveal] They're uncooked, but unprocessed? In a natural state?
							What about these uncooked carrots? [click to reveal] How "raw" are they?

							These carrots are standing in for "secondary" data, meaning data collected or put together by someone else. You, the person hoping to use the data, are walking through the grocery store.
							You can probably say which of these carrots are the least or most processed or "worked," but what else can you infer?
							Can you say how many people, how many processes or machines have these carrots gone through before getting to these states? As someone just walking through the grocery store, you have no way to know.
							The same is true of data encountered "in the wild;" unless you are specifically informed of everything that went into the creation of a dataset, you have no idea how "unprocessed" or "unworked" the data are!
							And, unlike carrots, with data you don't even know if you've come across baby carrots, shaved carrots, or what!

							One of the key points of a feminist approach to data, and a harder one to grasp, is that primary data, data you collect yourself, isn't really "raw" either!
							Thankfully I can extend the carrot metaphor further!
							Here we have some lovely carrots that we can imagine you (or maybe you and a team of others) grew yourselves.
							Okay, but how did you grow them? Like, you didn't invent carrots, so where did these carrots you pulled out of the ground come from?
							From carrot seeds! But whoever you bought those seeds from didn't invent carrots either. Where did carrots come from?

							In a shocking twist, just like me and most of the population of North America, carrots were brought here by European colonists.
							Our "modern" carrot was pretty widespread by ~ the 16th century and, interesting aside, orange wasn't even the most prominent color until about then!
							Bottom left is a Dutch painting c. 1630, upper right is Spanish from c. 1600, and bottom left is Dutch from c. 1560s.
							Okay, but where did those European carrots come from? How did they arrive in Europe for colonists to bring them to North America?

							Well, the carrot in those paintings is the product of selective breeding over the course of centuries, probably originating in ~ the 10th century in the area that's now Iran/Afghanistan/Pakistan.
							That "selective breeding" was of wild carrots, the cultivation of which began in that same area around 5000 years ago.

							These are illustrations from a 6th or 7th century Roman copy of a 1st century Greek codex of medicinal plants. Can already see the results of selective breeding! Top left is the "domestic" carrot, top right is the "wild" carrot, and bottom is what we now call a wild carrot. All three are now known to be same species of plant.
							Even our word for "carrot" developed from ancient Greek to Latin to French and finally English.

						What's the point?
						That even primary data that you collect yourself (or secondary data that you know everything about) results from a combination of historical and social contexts.
						We are always working within a specific social, historical, societal, etc. etc. context, and choosing to work within that context is indeed a choice.
