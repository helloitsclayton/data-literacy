					<h1>Raw data //<br>Raw carrots</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What does "raw" mean?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Uncooked; unprocessed, unrefined.<br>In a natural state; not yet processed or worked.<br><em style="font-size: x-large;">From the Oxford English Dictionary Online</em></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						[Be sure to give time to respond]
						Ask students if they've heard data referred to as "raw" and perhaps ask what that means to them.
					</aside>

						<div class="raw-carrots">
							<img class="carrot-1" src="img/carrot-whole.webp" />

						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							My argument is that data is "raw" in the same way that carrots are "raw"
							As you go through the different pictured examples of carrots, ask students if they'd agree with calling them "raw"
							They're definitely uncooked, but they definitely AREN'T in a natural state, not yet processed or worked
							Ask if students could describe what or how much processing the different types of "raw" carrots have gone through just by looking -- Probably some guesses, but it'd be difficult to say how many pairs of hands have touched each bit of carrot just by looking at the end result
							Finally, ask what they'd have to do in order to be certain
						</aside>

						<h2>"Secondary" data</h2>
						<div class="secondary-carrots">
							<img class="carrot-1" src="img/carrot-whole.webp" />

							<img class="carrot-3" src="img/carrot-sticks.webp" />
							<img class="carrot-4" src="img/carrot-shreds.webp" />
							<img class="carrot-5" src="img/carrot-chips.webp" />
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							These carrots are standing in for "secondary" data, meaning data that's already been published in some form by someone else
							We can't tell say with certainty how "processed" these carrots are just by looking, and the same is true of existing data sets
							Just like with carrots, if we wanted to be sure of the process data have gone through, we'd need to be informed somehow (observation or documentation)
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>"Tertiary" data</h2>
						<img src="img/babyFood.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							Tertiary data refers to published data that is in more aggregate form, so it's only possible to see averages, counts, or other summarizations of the data
							Be sure to warn students away from using tertiary data for their data biographies
						</aside>

						<h2>"Primary" data</h2>
						<div class="primary-carrots">
							<img class="carrot-1" src="img/dirty-carrots.jpg" />
							<img class="carrot-2 fragment" src="img/carrot-seeds.jpg" />
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							"Primary" data is data that has been produced by a researcher for their own purposes
							A key focus of this course, and of a feminist examination of data, is that primary data isn't actually "raw" either
							Running with the carrot metaphor further, in order to harvest carrots they need to be grown, and in order to grow carrots you would need seeds
							Where did carrot seeds come from? Where did carrots come from?

							Carrots were brought to North America by European colonists, probably the Dutch
							What we think of as the "modern" carrot was pretty widespread by ~ the 16th century (and, interesting aside, was much more common in other colors up until then)
							Upper right is Dutch c. 1630, bottom left is Spanish c. 1600, and bottom right is Dutch c. 1560s
							So carrots came here from Europe, but where did European carrots come from?

						<aside class="notes">
							Our modern carrot in those paintings is the product of centuries of selective breeding and probably originated in ~ the 10th century in the area that's now Iran/Afghanistan/Pakistan
							That "selective breeding" began with wild carrots which had been cultivated in that same area for around 4,000 years

							These are from a Roman copy of a 1st century CE Greek codex of medicinal plants and the results of selective breeding are already evident
							Top is what we'd now call a wild carrot, bottom left is the "domestic" carrot, and bottom right is their "wild" carrot; all are the same species, our wild and their wild are the same subspecies which wasn't recognized back then
							Even our word for "carrot" developed from ancient Greek to Latin to French and finally English

						The point is that, just like carrots, data doesn't spring out of nowhere
						Data (primary, secondary, or tertiary) always results from a combination of historical and social contexts, even if they're really boring sometimes (like height in feet and inches)
						Everything operates within a specific social, historical, societal, political, etc. etc. context, and if we are trying to understand how systems of power and data interact, it's essential to recognize those contexts exist
