					<h1>Science &amp; Proof</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						The intention here is to talk briefly about how common thinking around data (as a sort of contextless, objective view of the world) has its roots in very old ways of thinking about science and about proof
						These examples are kind of silly, though
					</aside>

						<h2>First example</h2>
						<div class="proofGrid">
							<img class="proofCeiling" src="img/pen.jpg" />
							<img class="proofRight" src="img/stickFigure.jpg" />
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							Someone has stuck my favorite pen to the ceiling; I need to reach the ceiling
							How easy is it to figure out how much taller I'd need to be to reach the ceiling?
							Pretty easy!
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Second example</h2>
						<div class="proofGrid">
							<img class="proofCeiling" src="img/quill.png" />
							<img class="proofNapo" src="img/napoleon.jpg" />
							<img class="proofRight" src="img/phoneBooth.webp" />
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							Someone has stuck Napoleon Bonaparte's favorite quill to the ceiling; when Napoleon Bonaparte arrives in his time machine he will need to reach the ceiling
							NOTE! This is Emperor of France-era Napoleon, he will not sit around and wait for us to measure him when he gets here! He expects results!
							So how easy is it to figure out how big of a ladder we'd need for Napoleon?
							Not as easy as finding out Napoleon's height isn't as straightforward as finding out my own
							He was rumored to be short, but this is now largely accepted as British propaganda from the early 1800s
							Interpretations of his height at death seem to vary, from 5'2" to 5'7", but this range it likely due to the difference in the French inch at that time (the <em>pouce</em>) and the Imperial inch
							Even something as seemingly straightforward as height can depend on cultural context!

						<h2>Data science and Enlightenment-era thinking</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							The Enlightenment occurred in Western Europe and its colonies around the late 18th/early 19th century, and a lot of current thinking around data has its roots that far back

							Early visualizations borrowed aesthetic choices from existing "authoritative" forms, like legal documents and pictorial representations of landscapes
							These were things like fonts used, their muted "natural" colors, and the overall minimalistic style (compared to older scientific diagrams)
							On the left are some visualizations by William Playfair, an influential British economist who was one of the first to use visualizations to the extent that he did; top is from 1822, bottom is from 1801
							Upper right is a work by JMW Turner, from 1796, lower right is by David Roberts, published in the 1840s
							The Playfair visualizations may look cluttered by present-day standards, but they were minimalistic for their time!

						<aside class="notes">
							Enlightenment thinkers viewed nature as an endless resource, one that existed to be tamed and used by humankind
							(Data is an endless resource to be "mined")
							They held the moral attitude that nature should "speak for itself," that scientists or naturalists should be as remote as possible (emotionally, physically, whatever) when observing or measuring phenomena
							("Letting data speak for itself," explored further in Data Feminism Chapter 6)
							As photography and other technologies developed in the 19th century, there was a growing assumption that these technologies were not limited by human subjectivity and therefore produced "objective" truth (our Feinberg reading from Class 2 mentioned this)
							(Data & statistics are objectively true, AI is infallible)
							The philosophy underpinning all of this was (and remains) that absolute truth exists and can be measured, or that objective knowledge is attainable by humans through enough observation
