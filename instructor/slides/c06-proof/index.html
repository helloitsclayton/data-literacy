						<h2>Data science and Enlightenment-era thinking</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							The Englightenment was around the late 18th/early 19th century, but a lot of current thinking around data has its roots that far back.
						</aside>

					<section>

						<aside class="notes">
							Early visualizations borrowed aesthetic choices from existing "authoratative" forms, like legal documents and pictoral representations of landscapes
							(Font choice, muted colors, minimalism)
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>

						<aside class="notes">
							The Enlightenment idea that nature's bounty was endless and existed to be tamed and used by humankind  
							(Data is an endless resource to be "mined")
							"Letting nature speak for itself," a moral attitude which held that scientists should be as remote as possible when observing or measuring phenomena  
							("Letting data speak for itself," explored further in Data Feminism Chapter 6)
							Photography and other technologies developed in the 19th century produced "objective" truth as they were not limited by human subjectivity  
							(Data & statistics are objectively true, AI is infallible)

					<aside class="notes">
						The philosophy underpinning all of this is that absolute truth exists and can be measured, or that objective knowledge exists and can be arrived at through enough observation.
