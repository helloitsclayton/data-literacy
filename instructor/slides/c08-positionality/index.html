							Thinking back to Class 6, we're going to expand a bit on how some feminist scholars pushed back against the idea of objectivity that continued (and continues) to pervade scientific thinking. Remember that the Enlightenment-era ideal of the "objective" scientific observer was as far removed (physically and emotionally) from their work

						<h2>The "God-Trick"</h2>
						<p>Visualizations of data often represent themselves not as arguments but as self-evident facts</p>
						<p>"The god-trick of seeing everything from nowhere"</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							This can even include something like a spreadsheet!
							Readers are made to feel that there's no point of view associated with what they're seeing and that there is nothing else to see that'd be important to the subject in question

						<h2>Donna Haraway</h2>
						<p>We each exist in a specific (social, political, historical, societal, etc. etc.) context</p>
						<p>Any knowledge we each might produce is marked by our specific (etc. etc.) context</p>
						<p>This is Haraway's notion of <em>situated knowledges</em></p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Feminist scholars in the 1980s and 90s were interested in objectivity as an idea (or ideal), but wanted to push back against the notion that it relies on the individual being completely removed from any context

						<h2>Donna Haraway</h2>
						<p>Related to situated knowledge:</p>
						<p>Everyone's point of view is inherently limited</p>
						<p>Any one person represents a <em>partial perspective</em> of reality</p>
						<aside class="notes">

					<section>
						<h2>Donna Haraway</h2>
						<p>The way to approach an "objective" understanding of reality is to recognize the situated nature of knowledge and gather together multiple partial perspectives</p>
						<p>(Haraway calls this <em>Feminist Objectivity</em>)</p>

						<h2>Sandra Harding</h2>
						<p>Built on Haraway's concept of Feminist Objectivity by incorporating <em>Standpoint Theory</em>:</p>
						<p>That society privileges knowledge from certain intersections of social categories, and marginalizes others</p>

						<h2>Sandra Harding</h2>
						<p>An inclusive model of "objectivity" should take this into account, and should center knowledge produced those who have been previously excluded</p>
						<p>(Harding calls this <em>Strong Objectivity</em>)</p>
