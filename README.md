# Social Justice and Data: An Open Course

## Course description

Becoming "data conversant" is only growing in importance as data-related practice becomes increasingly ingrained in public and academic discourse. Learning data-related skills, like reading, working with, analyzing, and arguing with data, is often viewed as a purely technical process that centers mastery of coding or data analysis software.

Instead, this course will take a justice-centered approach that examines how systems of power affect and are affected by data. Students will gain practical experience through low-tech explorations of real-world data, but we won't shy away from or gloss over data's inherent complexities. And data are complex, just like the people who are responsible for their creation, curation, and use.

To help us navigate these murky waters, and to move past number crunching to deeper critical analysis, we'll be drawing on the expertise of scholars, practitioners, and enthusiasts from an array of disciplines and backgrounds.

There are no prerequisites for this course.
