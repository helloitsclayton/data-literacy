# Social Justice and Data Lesson Plan

## Week 1

### Class 1 - Course introduction

- Opening activity - ["Paper Spreadsheet"](https://databasic.io/en/culture/paper-spreadsheet) from the Data Culture Project. Have students fill this out as they come into class.
- Go over the course's syllabus and the LMS page for the course.
- Return to "Paper Spreadsheet" for discussion outlined in activity.
- Introduce a few datasets we may be working with regularly?
- At the end of class, assign the "background info" questionnaire via course page, intended to help me learn more about the class' interest/needs, "due" by next class.
- Assigned readings (for next class):
   - [The Myth of Objective Data](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-myth-of-objective-data/) by Melanie Fienberg (2023)
- Assigned readings (to complete by Class 4):
   - *Data Feminism* [Introduction](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/frfa9szd/release/6)
   - *Data Feminism* [Chapter 1](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/vi8obxh7/release/4)

### Class 2 - Defining data

- Reading completed ahead of class:
   - The Myth of Objective Data by Melanie Fienberg (2023)
- Introduce "Daily Data Discussions," taking 5 minutes or so at the start of each class for us to offer examples of how data has come up in our lives â€“ be sure to have your own example to kick things off!
- Small group discussion:
   - How did you feel about Feinberg's discussion of data?
   - How does her characterization of data agree or disagree with your understanding of data?
- Lecture: Raw Data // Raw Carrots
- Data vs. Statistics vs. Visualizations
- Introduce Data Biographies assignment and some related examples:
   - Datasheets for datasets by Gebru et al. (2021)
   - Data biographies: Getting to know your data by Krause (2017)
   - WPRDC data user guides (n.d.)

> [!NOTE]
> Between Classes 2 and 3, I emailed students with a collection of possible data sources for use in their Data Biography assignment, but students mostly chose their own. They did a terrible job, though, so I plan to include some intervention/consultation during Week 2.

## Week 2

### Class 3

- Reading due:
   - Data Materiality: Yanni Loukissas on understanding and designing data settings
- Briefly revisit previous class' discussion:
   - Situated knowledge, partial perspective
   - In order to apply those concepts to data we need to know where our data is coming from!
- Activity: "Asking Good Questions" w/ WTFcsv by Data Culture Project
   - Example dataset: Ohio UFO sightings CSV
   - For student evaluation: two months of traffic stop data from the Charlotte's Officer Traffic Stops dataset

### Class 4

- Readings due:
   - Summary of the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study by Portes & Rumbaut
   - Abstract, Data and Method, & Discussion and Conclusion of "The Female Educational Advantage Among Adolescent Children of Immigrants" by Feliciano (2012)
      - OA alternative: "Feeling Unsafe at School" by Maffini (2016), Abstract & Introduction (pp. 1-2), Participants and Procedures (pp. 5-6), Discussion (pp. 9-11)
- Brief sketch of the research data lifecycle(s) and how/why data biographies might fit into the research process (see "Creative Data Literacy" by D'Ignazio, pp. 9-11)
- Small group discussions:
   1. What reasoning is given in the research article for working with CILS data?
   2. What other reasons or factors might have contributed to the use of CILS data but were not mentioned?
   3. In the "Data and Methods" section of the Feliciano article (or the Discussion section of the Maffini article), the author describes the limitations of the dataset in addressing their research question. Do you think the overall conclusions drawn in the article are justified given those limitations? Why or why not?

Class 6
- Readings due:
   - *Data Feminism* Introduction
   - *Data Feminism* Chapter 1
- Small group discussions:
   1. What are some ways unequal distributions of power show up in the datasets we've looked at or talked about so far? (CILS, Traffic Stops, or even the class 1 paper spreadsheet)
   2. How might those examples connect with the Matrix of Domination framework outlined in Ch. 1?
- In the last few minutes, I introduced Race Forward's "levels of racism" as another framework with some clear connections to the Matrix of Domination

## Week 3

### Class 5

- Assignments:
   - Data Biographies due at beginning of class
- Introduce Research Inquiry assignment
- "Build and Analyze a Network" activity using ConnectTheDots by Data Culture Project

### Class 6

- Readings due:
  - *Data Feminism* Chapter 4
- Asked students for reactions & thoughts about Ch. 4
- Looking back at the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS) and the extended influence of datasets, i.e., the number of publications that have come out of this one dataset.
- Looked at first page of "Educational pathway and social mobility in children of immigrants" by Dunn (2019) and the disconnect of that use with the purposes of the original dataset
- Finally, asked students to evaluate and compare the 2010 and 2020 Census questionnaires and think about what's getting counted.
Class 9
Readings due:
The Conversation: Is bad data killing women? ft. Caroline Criado Perez and Lauren Klein
Discussion:
Responding to the Data Biography assignment
Is collecting data enough?

## Week 4

### Class 7

- Readings:
   - Text as Data by Maseda (2021)
   - Sketching with Data by Chalabi & Gray (2021)
- "Sketch a Story" activity w/ WordCounter
This went so badly! I wanted to give the students something more "social justice" related to work with but didn't give myself enough time to find appropriate materials.

### Class 8

- Reading:
   - Selected sections of "Extra-Activism" by Kidd: 'Maps, extractivism and treaties' (p. 10) through 'The Inuit maps and Nunavut' (p. 18)
   - *Data Feminism* Chapter 5
I was surprised by how difficult students found Kidd's article. I think the Inuit maps offer a great example of a "nontraditional" data gathering process that resulted in actual systemic change, but one that relied on a specific context. Other, similar projects have not been as successful.
- Small group discussion:
   1. What connections can you draw between Ch. 5 and counter-mapping as described in Kidd's article?
   2. Between Kidd's article and other topics we've covered? (Power, What gets counted, etc.)
   3. I probably needed to be more explicit in how I saw the two readings connecting, e.g., working from the margins and collective action.
- Introduce Dear Data let students know we'll be doing it for a week, ask students to think about what we might keep track of
   - Share Dear Data postcards on MoMA's website for students to look through for inspiration

Class 12
- Data and context collapse:
   - Data and Excel ([renaming genes](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates), [UK covid test data](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/how-excel-may-have-caused-loss-of-16000-covid-tests-in-england))
   - Ex of walking route over time from *Rethinking the Power of Maps*
- Dear Data - Make final decision on topic
- Activity: Have students come up with a plan for cleaning data in small groups  
The first step in most data analysis processes is to "clean" the data so that the process can be more easily automated. For this activity, you'll be looking at the [Mapping Police Violence dataset](https://airtable.com/shroOenW19l1m3w0H) and considering how you might go about this:
   1. Scroll left in the dataset to get a sense for the number of variables (i.e., the number of columns). A description of the different variables can be found in the data documentation. If you were downloading this data set for your own purposes, would you be interested in all of the variables? Which variables might you leave out (and why)?
   2. The layout makes it pretty obvious when an individual piece of data is missing, like the "age" of the person in row 9 or the "race" of the person in row 25. What might you do with these gaps? (Also, you can have a different approach depending on the variable/column)
   3. There are a few different geographic variables in the dataset, some with a lot of variation in how they're recorded (like "street_address"). If you wanted to associate each data point/incident/row with a single more uniform geographic variable, what might you do?
   4. What would you do with the "circumstances" variable/column, which contains plain-text descriptions of the incidents pulled from news reports? Would you keep it as-is, try to reduce it down in some way (maybe come up with categories like for the other variables?), leave the variable out altogether, or something else?
   5. BONUS/food for thought: What do you do with data points with more than one thing in them, like "agency_responsible" in row 14?

## Week 5

### Class 9

- A variation on the SameDiff activity from DataBasic.io instead using the text of speeches by prominent civil rights/social justice figures. I asked students to illustrate what two selected speakers might have agreed on or might have differed on.
> [!NOTE]
> Based on the issues we had with the WordCounter activity, I wanted to try something else. Most of the transcribed speeches were from a website called So*Just, which has a page on Social Justice and Human Rights Speeches (though I can't guarantee accuracy).
>
> I supplemented this by searching for speeches by other folks, like Angela Davis, Greta Thunberg, James Baldwin, and Malala Yousafzai.

### Class 10

- Readings:
   - Data Feminism Chapter 3
- Introduce final presentation assignment

Class 15
- Readings:
   - Selected sections of "Many analysts, one data set" by Silberzahn et al.: Abstract (p. 338), Crowdsourcing Data Analysis (pp. 338-9), Stages of the Crowdsourcing Process (p. 340), Stage 1 (pp. 340-1), Generalizability to Other Data Sets through the end of the article (including Notes) (pp. 353-5)
- Algorithm case study?

## Week 6

### Class 11

- Readings:

- Dear Data part 2 - Creating "postcards"

### Class 12

- Readings:
   - *Data Feminism* Chapter 6
- Activity: [Fox News article](https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-prison-data-blows-up-narrative-that-low-level-drug-offenders-are-filling-up-u-s-prisons-experts) and [BJS data](https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/prisoners-2021-statistical-tables)
   - This Fox News article makes the argument that drug-related convictions are not that serious of an issue, and specifically that  
"Data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) show only 12.6% of state prisoners are behind bars for drug-related crimes and only 3.2% are locked up on possession charges â€“ while five times as many people are in state prisons for violent crimes rather than drug charges."
   1. Can you find where in the linked report they pull those two statistics from? (Give a page or table number.)
   2. What other statistics contained in the report support or contradict the Fox News article's argument? (Look at tables near the one where they got their statistics)
   3. Do you agree with Fox News' argument? What other information might you want/need before making your own conclusion?

Class 18

   - "On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots" by Bender et al.
   - Algorithmic Accountability: A Primer by Caplan et al.
- Algorithms, data, and AI
- Data decontextualized

## Week 7

### Class 13

- Final reflection draft due
- Activity: Peer review of final reflection
   - This form will take you through the peer review process for each paper you're reviewing. Broadly, there are two topics on which you'll be providing comments:  
Process - how previous assignments and in-class work affected the formulation of their research question and how they might go about investigating it.  
Data & Data Science - how their relationship with data, data science, and data-related research may have changed based on topics we've covered.
   - Topic 1: Process  
This paper should discuss the process involved in the first two assignments, how the Data Biography assignment and in-class activities affected the question chosen by the author for their Research Inquiry assignment.  
It should also discuss the effects of these factors on how they thought about investigating their chosen question.
      1. What did you find most effective, interesting, or insightful about the description of their process?
      2. What aspects of their process could've been described more clearly or effectively? Is there anything you think they should've discussed in more detail, or anything you wish they had been more clear about?
   - Topic 2: Data & Data Science  
This paper should also discuss how the topics covered in this class have (or have not) fit into the author's existing idea of data and data science. It should also speak to how the author's approach to data-related research may have changed based on the topics covered in class.
      1. What did you find most effective, interesting, or insightful about the author's description of their relationship with data, data science, and/or data-related research?
      2. What aspects of their relationship with data, data science, and/or data-related research could've been described more clearly or effectively? Is there anything you think they should've discussed in more detail, or anything you wish they had been more clear about?
   - Final thoughts  
Please provide any final thoughts or comments you might have for the author:

*Optional*

## Assignment 1: Dataset Biography

A short paper (2-3 pages) introducing a selected dataset and discussing how it came into existence. Please include a link to the dataset - a properly formatted citation in your chosen style would be best - as part of the paper.

As the name implies, you're writing a (concise) biography of that dataset. A good place to start is with the Five Ws: Who, What, When, Where, and Why. Feel free to throw How into the mix as well!

Be warned, though, many datasets won't just tell you the answers to those questions. In fact, sometimes that information might never have been recorded in the first place. For our purposes, then, I want you to comment on any major gaps you notice.

Below are three very different approaches that you can consider:
- ["Data Biographies: Getting to Know Your Data" by Heather Krause](https://gijn.org/2017/03/27/data-biographies-getting-to-know-your-data/)  
A journalistic approach, one that makes sense if you're looking at someone else's dataset
- ["Datasheets for Datasets" by Gebru et al., in *Communications of the ACM*](https://doi.org/10.1145/3458723)  
Extremely detailed and technical, probably most useful if you generated the dataset
- [*Data User Guides* from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center](https://github.com/rgradeck/Data-User-Guides/blob/master/README.md)  
Also intended for self-generated data, but less technical and more open-ended

## Assignment 2: Research Inquiry

A short paper (2-3 pages) which presents and discusses a research question that has grown out of your examination of a selected dataset. The question should be a reaction to the trends, gaps, or other aspects of the dataset. Think back to our in-class activity where you came up with questions about the Charlotte, NC Traffic Stops dataset. That, along with other in-class data storytelling activities, should be good examples of the process for coming up with a research question.

The paper itself should discuss how the question was inspired by the dataset (i.e., what was it in the dataset that led you to ask this question?) along with which aspects of your question are covered by your dataset. You should also discuss what other datasets might be required and where might you find that information. What other resources could or should be incorporated (books, articles, etc.)?

A few hopefully reassuring notes:

1. You won't actually be undertaking this research during the class, so you don't need to worry about over-promising or giving yourself too much work by asking a really exciting (but complicated) question.
2. The dataset you use for this assignment does not have to be the same one you used for the Data Biography assignment. If you do choose a new dataset, though, I'd encourage you to at least think through those biographical questions before starting with this assignment.

## Assignment 3: Draft Presentation & Reflection

A short paper (4-5 pages) reflecting on the research process as well as a draft slide deck or script (or anything else that could be considered a presentation draft). See the Final Presentation & Reflection assignment description for full details on what these should cover and how they should fit together.

What I expect in this draft is a 4-5 page paper that your classmates and I can provide feedback on (we will be doing some peer reviewing) along with a draft slide deck/script/outline/etc. showing how you have thought about creating your final presentation. **You will not be giving a "draft" presentation at this time.**

## Assignment 4: Final Presentation & Reflection

A short paper (4-5 pages) reflecting on the research process as well as a 5-minute presentation which will be given the last two days of class. The reflection should be a longer version of what you will cover in your presentation. 5 minutes is less than you think, so the paper is an opportunity to discuss the topics in your presentation at greater length and in greater detail.

This assignment should address the process that you have gone through in the first two assignments, as well as what steps you would take in order to investigate the question proposed in your Research Inquiry assignment. How did the Data Biography or our in-class activities affect your research question? How might they affect the way you'd plan to investigate that question?

I am also interested in hearing how the topics we've covered in class have (or have not) fit into your existing idea of what data and data science are. Will it change how you approach data-related research in the future, either research you do or research you read about? If so, how?

I'm not expecting anything specific in terms of the format of the presentation. A slide deck seems like a reasonable starting point but is not required. It should be able to stand on its own as a coherent expression of the work you've done (meaning we should be able to understand it without having to read the paper), and the Reflection should provide me with additional insight and detail regarding what you've talked about in the presentation.

Your submission here should be the paper along with any supporting materials (slides, etc.) from your presentation.

# Materials, misc. links, etc.

I used this tool to randomize students and assign small groups and peer reviewing: https://www.randomlists.com/team-generator

I bought an array of crayola markers, crayons, and colored pencils to use with the various art-forward activities. Students seemed to respond very well to this and enjoyed the process (though many were nervous about their art skills).

I used 18" x 24" white drawing paper for everything but the Dear Data activity, which I bought from an art supplies store (along with the drawing materials above).

From the same store I bought blank postcards for Dear Data, though I realized after a student pointed it out that the "standard" (4"x6") postcards I bought were much smaller than the ones used in the project. Theirs were around 5.5"x8.5", so half of a standard letter-sized paper might work better.
