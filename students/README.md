# Student Materials

## Course Readings

[`Course Readings.md`](https://github.com/helloitsclayton/data-literacy/blob/main/students/Course-Readings.md) contains all of the assigned readings for this course. The book *Data Feminism* is the only assigned text for this course, but many classes also include supplemental readings drawn from a wide range of literature.

Links are provided (and there are links for every reading), and in cases when specific sections of an article are assigned I've tried to be as clear as possible about what is assigned and what isn't.

## Class-specific Folders

There are folders for certain classes (e.g., `Class-05`) which contain data files that are used in activities during those classes. Specific instructions for what to do with those data files will be provided during the relevant class and you don't need to worry about them until then.
