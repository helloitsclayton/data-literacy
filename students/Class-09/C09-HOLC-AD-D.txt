Factory workers and laborers This is the poorest residential section in Berea. Comprised mostly of old, cheaply constructed homes and shacks. Populated by 50% Negro & 30% Foreign. Flat terrain. Lots 30-50 x 100; Pearl Rd. is paved -- all others slag and cindered; all utilities installed; good transportation; abuts railroad along northern boundary; Dunham Foundry, Ohio Nut & Bolt Co. and the Foxy Toy Co. located in this area. Many of the occupants are employed there. The Dunham Co. brought colored people from the south to work in this foundry. Employs about a third of them now (formerly 1000 now 300). The boundaries of this area will remain pretty much intact. The better people are slowly moving out. Rental collections are difficult and real estate activity is stagnant. Mortgage money is unobtainable. No HOLC or other institutional sales reported in this area during past three years. Trend is rapidly downward. Accordingly, the area is given a very poor fourth grade rating.
Laborers This small totally colored community was the result of an independent movement and development surrounding the construction of their church in this area some 25 years ago. No streets are paved and lack of maintenance through the years has given this area its name of "Shantytown". Presence of this community has had a very detrimental effect on surrounding area property values, particularly to the immediate south. Utilities are available to area. This section is now about 75-80% built up and, apparently, is solidly entrenched, in fact this area, prior to Miles Heights annexation to Cleveland in 1932, was able to elect a negro as Mayor of Miles Heights. Area will remain static but may spread into Garfield Heights (S.W) if the purchasing power of the colored residents increases enough to buy this property, (lying to south) now in the $1800-3500 bracket which has virtually no market for white due to proximity to this colored neighborhood.
Workingmen - mechanics - craftsmen, etc. This small workingmen's district has been given a 4th grade rating due to complete isolation (only one outlet), heavy turnover in foreclosures just now being completed, complete encirclement by industrial zoned property, adjacency to industry (Cleveland Illuminating Co.) on west border and proximity to Erie RR (north boundary) over which children in area must traverse to and from school. Area is approx. 1/2 mile from schools, 1 mile from churches, 1/2 mile to stores. Transportation is along Miles Ave. just north of area. High taxes, prior to annexation, due to pavement of streets brought on a heavy foreclosures rate but change of ownership has been virtually completed. Area is now 75% built up, but contains in all only about 40-50 homes. No improvement in area is looked for in the future except new ownership should be stable. Greatest disadvantage to area is its single outlet over the Erie RR to Miles Ave.
Laborers - Small business owners - Peddlers (Heavy relied rolls) This area's development began about 25 years ago and was featured by the heavy percentage of "Jerry-type" construction throughout. Almost immediately the commercial district along Kinsman became solidly Jewish-owned and a heavy infiltration of Russian-Jewish and Italian occurred between 1920-30 and although slower since then has continued up to date. Beginning with about 1928 a movement of colored from the downtown areas started in this section and progressed with moderate success up until about 3 years ago when the movement became more pronounced, and at present is continuing steadily. The heavy slump in price valuation in property in this area occurring following the depression made some recovery up to 1937 with improved general business conditions but is again sliding due to lack of maintenance and constant infiltration from these elements. A boom of commercial property along Kinsman Rd. was experienced in 1928 but collapsed and did not materially affect residential property values. This area throughout shows poor maintenance and rapid depreciation of property is characteristic of these inhabitants. Informed realtor's opinion is that this section should have been, at the outset, developed for colored occupancy as an overflow outlet for the strong movement that has progressed into the northeastern part of Cleveland. However no concerted effort was made and the present occupancy has resulted from the normal characteristic of colored infiltration into Jewish & Italian neighborhoods with the obsolescence of property due to lack of maintenance. The apparent future for this area will be an increasing occupancy ratio by Jewish, Italian and colored with a steady fall in price value.
Predominantly steel and factory workers This older section (entire western and southern boundary abutting industry and railroad property) gradually rises on a slope to the east from E. 93rd St. Section was developed first about 40 yrs. ago in the western part and area is now 98% built up on lots ranging from 30-35' frontage (only two streets, now partially filled in, remain undeveloped). This area naturally is detrimentally affected by smoke, dirt and soot from adjacent railroads, foundries and steel and iron works. Homes west of E. 93rd are smallest and cheapest; homes along eastern boundary of area and such streets as Raymond and Heath are better and average about 25 yrs. age. Main thoroughfares for this section are E. 93rd (crosstown connection) and Union and Aetna Aves. (east-west). The commercial district is scattered along E. 93rd, heaviest at E. 93rd and Union and extreme north boundary abutting Erie RR are smaller and cheaper conforming with homes west of E. 93rd as mentioned above. This area's occupants contains a large percentage of Slovaks and many long time resident Irish hold here by the Catholic parishes at St. Catherine Ave. & E. 93rd and at Aetna Rd. and E. 93rd St. Some small volume of mortgage lending still continues in this section on a limited basis, principally on better kept property surrounding the churches. However the age of property, complete development (congested due to small lots) and detrimental influence of nearby industry penalizes this area to 4th grade class, although it still has desirability as a factory worker's district within walking distance to employment at the western boundary consisting of such firms as the Allyne Ryan Foundry, Draper Barrel & Drum Co., Pneumatic Tool, Champion Rivet and several other small steel & iron concerns.
Mechanics - Steel workers - Laborers This workingman's "thoroughfare" district has suffered from many setbacks and detrimental influences over the past 50 yrs. Originally the American Steel & Wire Co. (formerly abutting area on the north) employed many occupants of area but moved its plant to Lorain, Ohio, throwing most of these people out of employment and their homes on the market. The area is affected by noise, soot and dirt of railroads, nearby industry, and very heavy vehicular traffic. The elevation of the Penna. R.R. dissecting the area, improved traffic but detrimentally affected surrounding property values and caused the main thoroughfares in northern part (Broadway & Harvard) to change grade and dip at their intersection. Home sin this northern half are much older (avg. 45-50 yrs.) than in southern part (avg. 18-22 yrs.). Polish occupancy is principally along side streets off Broadway in northern part. There is a scattering of Italian through southwesterly corner, principally in homes in edge overlooking the industrial ravine to the west. The commercial district is centered at Broadway & Harvard but light commercial structures continue along those thoroughfares and northern part of Warner Rd. Future for this 4th grade area, due to slow foreign encroachment -- age of properties -- dissection by railroads -- and proximity to industry, will be slowly down.
Steel workers This heavily concentrated Polish neighborhood, primarily a steel and factory worker's district, is about 50 yrs. old in the portion north of Fleet and along Broadway; about 10-15 yrs. younger in part of area west of E. 71st St. and south of Fleet. Industrial property and railroads virtually surround this area except that part of southwesterly boundary abutting Washington Park. Most of the inhabitants here are employed by Republic, Otis, U.S. Steel and Aluminum Co. of America (abutting area.) The area is distinguished by its heavy concentration of 2-family homes, not located in any particular section but grouped in sets of 10-12 -- apparently built in rows by contractors. Several long one-floor plan singles (approx. 5% of total) have been converted into 2-family utility. Here and there pride of ownership is evident in inexpensive improvement, such as new lawns and upkeep of shrubbery but on the whole, limited income of these residents leaves much to be desired in renovation. The small commercial structures are scattered along thorofares of Broadway, Fleet, Aetna and Harvard. Area has good transportation, school and social centers, such as lodges and halls; two large Polish Catholic Churches are located in 3rd grade neighborhood surrounded by this area. Main shopping center for this district is located in 4th grade area to the north along Broadway. This fully built-up section, although old and detrimentally affected by smoke, soot, fumes and dirt, is stable due to the type of inhabitants, (Polish), high home ownership ratio and proximity of employment.
Steel workers This Broadway-East 55th Section has the largest shopping center immediately southeast of the downtown area and contains the highest concentration of Bohemian population including their social centers of churches, halls, schools, and lodges. This area is primarily a steel factory worker's district (Republic, Otis and U.S. Steel about western boundary). The stability of population and gregarious instinct of the inhabitants has held the desirability of this neighborhood beyond its detrimental influences such as smoke, dirt, and soot from industry and noise of heavy traffic. Consequently rental and sales demand has always been good although these people are "thight raders". This area has ample transportation, school, church and social facilities. There is an evident pride of home ownership although income of owners is too small to permit regular exterior painting and other modernization. The trend of this neighborhood will remain mostly unchanged except for the gradual obsolescence of property due to age. Although owner occupancy has been shown as 85%, the thrifty habit of these people in purchasing adjacent property should qualify in the strong holding of an additional 10% by individuals (in other words, not unwillingly hold). A very strong effort has been maintained to limit the inhabitants of this area to white only and no negro encroachment is anticipated, although approximately 10 negro families are located in the northernmost section along E. 33rd. Area is 100% built up.
Laborers - Few steel workers - warehouse & market workers This area, almost completely surrounded by industrial concentration, is the second most undesirable residential area on the east side. Up until 12 years ago it was almost solidly occupied by Hungarian and Slovak population but with the lessening of industrial activity and lack of upkeep in dwellings, a steady movement of Hungarian families from this neighborhood brought an immediate infiltration of colored from the Outhwaite section lying to the northwest. This infiltration has continued, principally, along Kinsman in the northwestern part of area. At present, property values have virtually reached their maximum depreciation and sales are almost at a standstill except for speculative purposes by owners with purpose of renting to colored in mind for higher rental income. Responsibility for this change was hastened by the electrification of the New York Central RR lines, which in many cases made dead-end streets, and the closing of factories in the depression following '29. The general detriments caused by proximity to industry are all apparent and the lack of upkeep in property will continue to attract colored occupancy. The main thoroughfare for this district is Kinsman Rd. along which commercial property is scattered. The only possible improvement or change from the present rate of colored infiltration would be the renewal of industrial activity which would attract white factory workers back to this area thus creating a market for the sale of heavy institutional holdings. Social facilities are noticeably lacking in this area consisting of one grade school and one junior high and a few churches. Area is 99% built up.
Laborers - Peddlers - Factory warehouse workers This old downtown, foreign, heavily negro populated section is bordered on two of its three sides by industries and railroads. Area was laid out and developed over 100 years ago into small lots 32 ft. x 120 ft. and developed almost exclusively along side streets with small frame homes many of which have been demolished to make way for commerce along thoroughfares, and to provide room for the existing large warehouses along Broadway south to the railroads. Area has one of the most dense populations in the city. Concentration of negro population in this area is the heaviest in the city. Area is characterized by its heavy relief rolls, high disease and mortality rate, crime and unemployment. This is the most undesirable area in entire city. Food marketing for the city of Cleveland is concentrated in this section which includes the city's largest warehousing and trucking facilities, contains two of Cleveland's four government housing projects. One located in the block formed by Cedar, Central, E. 26th and E. 30th. The other in the block formed by Scovill, Woodland, E. 40th and E. 55th St.
Factory workers This area was platted over 100 years ago and developed into lots on side streets averaging 30 ft x 120 ft. The obsolescence of residences, encroachment of commerce and light industrial plants into this area (due to its age and expiring restrictions) and immediate proximity to the downtown business section, have taken their toll on desirability of this area from a residential standpoint. The present occupants of this section, in many cases, have two dwellings on one lot and the population decrease is occasioned by demolition of dwelling structures which have reached their maximum depreciation to the point that value rests entirely on the land for commercial and light industrial use (average 50Â¢ per sq. ft.). At the time being, the area is zoned for apartments, commerce and grade "B" (light) industrial. Future for this area lies only in the enhancement of land value for industrial and commercial use.
Laborers- factory workers- railroaders This allotment, known as "Old Lindale", was laid out in 1910 with 25'-40' lots; it is not approximately 50% built up; 40% of streets are paved, remainder dirt and slag (WPA slagged several streets this year); gas, water, light and sewer available to homes already constructed; bus transportation 92o minute service during day) on W. 130th which runs north and south to center of area (W. 130th is scheduled for widening and new pavement in 1940 from the point just completed this year at the railroad (Area C-16) through to Wooster Pike). A grade school is located on Longmead (just north of area) and a Catholic school (St. Paul's) at W. 130th and Bennington; some retail stores are located on W. 130th. There is a gradual infiltration of foreign, principally Italian and Slavish with some negroes. The negro element, which is an overflow settlement from area D-3 (north) is concentrated on Wileon and Wainfleet Aves. in the northwest section of area. Foreclosures here are heavier than average and considerable difficulty is experienced in selling. The single houses range from $800-$4500 and two-family and multiple units, from $3500-5800. Many of the area's occupants are employed in the industries abutting the community. Proximity to industry is area's best claim and it will retain present population for a few years at least, without marked increase of negro infiltration.
All types - laborers - clerks - domestic workers - small business men This large old area was formerly the main residential section of the east side of Cleveland. As early as 1890 it was fairly heavily developed and is now built up almost 100%. Portion of area from Hough Ave. to the south was once a fashionable section of large old mansions now depopulated by the owners and many have been converted into boarding houses and sanatoriums which the balance have been torn down to make way for commercial and apartment structures. The portion of area north of Hough Ave. was formerly the district of business owners and high grade factory workers, which, due to age and infiltration, has now gained a heavy foreign occupancy. The large single homes and heavy development antedated the two family structure popularity so that at present only approximately 10% of the buildings are of the up-and-down 2-family type. This area also falls into two rental medium groups -- south of Hough Ave. rental medium is approximately $35-45; north of Hough rentals are $25-35. The area has gone rapidly to commercial structures along its main arteries such as: St. Clair, Superior, Wade Park, Hough and Euclid. The southeastern corner of area includes the largest shopping and commercial center east of the downtown business district at the intersection of E. 105th and Euclid. Stability of area, particularly southern part, depends primarily on its potential growth as the largest apartment section immediately east of the downtown area. As for the central and northern part, gradual obsolescence of single-family homes hold very little except a slow declining future. Center of area contains "red-light district" concentrated at Hough and E. 79th St. spreading over several blocks, principally to the east and west.
(White) Peddlers - Junk Dealers - Small Business Men - Laborers (Colored) Service workers - Domestic - Waiters - Porters, etc. This area, although somewhat younger than the 4th grade area immediately to the west, is a continuation of the negro belt but has experienced, to a lesser degree, the detrimental change of ownership occupancy from white to colored. Prior to the World War, and as early as 1910, this area had only a scattering of colored occupancy in the northwest corner. At that time and up until 1920 a change of ownership principally to Russian-Jewish occurred. From the period of 1920-30 colored infiltration came very strongly along the thoroughfare of Cedar in the north and Quiney in the south (almost totally colored now). There is a concentration of Hungarians along Buckeye Rd. and of Italians in the extreme easterly part of district. This area contains the southern portion of the very large commercial and shopping district centered at E. 105th and Euclid. Large old mansions located on Cedar and Carnegie have been converted into rooming houses or are being torn down to make way for commercial structures. Business is scattered throughout along Carnegie, Cedar, Quincy, Buckeye and Woodhill Rd. There is also a commercial center at Buckeye and Woodhill Rd. The portion of area lying east of Woodhill Rd. is considerably newer. Development here has been predominantly of two-family structure -- occupancy heavily Italian -- no colored. Area includes Lunn Park section recently purchased for government housing project now underway. This small portion of area has been the scene of violent crime and gangster activity, particularly during prohibition days. The trend for this area (now about 99% built up) is definitely downward since colored infiltration from 4th grade area to the west will continue strongly (very heavy during the past 3 years). There is a conserted effort being made by the better class colored in this section to locate in the 4th grade area along E. 105th north of Wade Park but institutions have agreed not to sell to them.
Wholesale (Food) Employees - Laborers - Small contractors & gardeners This well-known Italian settlement has gained notoriety from the activities of the so-called "Mayfield Road mob" which figured prominently in gangster activities during prohibition and is said to be still active. Residents here are primarily engaged in the wholesale products work (fresh fruit and vegetables) which is concentrated in the 4th grade downtown area - D18. The native characteristic of these occupants is evident in their heavy population (large families) and lack of property maintenance. This area has some attraction to Italians living in the downtown Woodland Ave. district whose homes have reached the point of being uninhabitable causing them to move to this section. Owners of property in this area do most of their real estate transactions direct with purchaser and, according to informed realtor's opinion, are able to obtain prices in excess of the economic value of their property. No change is looked for in this area during the next few years, except that colleges abutting the west boundary would like to absorb this section as rapidly as their funds permit. This fully built up area has its own churches, schools and settlement houses.
Merchants - small business men - salesmen - white collared
Laborers-factory workers This small area lying in the southwestern corner of East Cleveland abutting Lake View Cemetery, Goff-Kirby Coal Yard and railroad is the least desirable residential section of this community. This section was laid out about 45 years ago and lots average about 35 ft. frontage. The present occupants have utilized original large single family structures as multiple unit housing and population density in this section is very heavy. The informed realtor's opinion is that no mortgage funds have been available, even on limited terms, for the past 15 years in this area. Occupants are of the lowest income bracket, and relief rolls have been exceptionally heavy here.
Factory - Railroad Shop Workers - Craftsmen - Cement & stone workers This fairly old area was laid out about 50 years ago as part of the Village of Collinwood into small lots averaging 30 ft. x 100 ft., although there are a few above and beneath this bracket. The ratio of singles and two-family homes varies on either side of St. Clair Ave., the main artery through this section. This ratio, north of St. Clair is 70% singles and 30% two-family and south of St. Clair is 60% singles and 40% two-family. Homes north of St. Clair range in age up to 45 years, the oldest of which were originally built without foundations and utilities and have since been remodeled. Properties south of St. Clair are considerably newer and range up to 30 yrs. with two families somewhat newer. Racial occupancy in this primarily industrial neighborhood also varies being almost solidly Italian south of St. Clair and East of Ivanhoe R. and heavily Slav north of St. Clair. Area suffered heavily during the depression, due to its predominancy of factory workers, and foreclosures were heavy. However, with the upturn in business during 1935-36 institutional sales on small down payment basis have been satisfactory. Property values in area have not recovered sharply because of the limited income of prospective purchasers who, through broken employment in such nearby industries as Fisher Body (abutting west boundary), New York Central Railroad Shop, Briggs and Apox Mfg. companies and various other industries, has not permitted the accumulation of more than a small down payment which prevents real estate transaction other than by institutions in liquidation. Example: Many of the 600 employees recently recalled to the Collinwoord Railroad shops, from a lay-off since July lived in this section. This fully built up industrial section will remain much the same for the next few years because of its advantageous location to nearby industries and transportation and occupancy desirability for the low income group. A slow infiltration of Italian may occur, although the area has had little shifting of population inside its boundaries.
Laborers - factory workers - some white collared This 4th grade area (entire south boundary) abutting industrial and railroad property) was laid out 35-40 yrs. ago and developed with cheap single homes mixed with a few converted two-family structures ranging from 1-1 1/2 to 2 sty. dwellings. Occupancy here was always of the working class and heavily populated by foreign. Within the past few years, a slow infiltration of colored has occurred who now live, principally, on Thames and Darwin in the western part of this section. The long easterly projection of this area is a strip of properties abutting the main thoroughfare Waterloo Rd. running from E. 152nd to E. 185th. Properties in this long strip either adjoin or abut many light industrial or semi-commercial properties. Traffic is very heavy along this thoroughfare (Waterloo). Informed realtor's opinion is that lending institutions will not make loans in this section or, if at all, only primarily in that part of area west of E. 140th which contains the better properties and more desirable occupants. Future for this 75% built up area will be slowly down and present slow rate of colored infiltration is not expected to materially increase.
Factory workers - laborers This foreign section was developed about 25 yrs. ago with 1 to 1 1/2 sty. frame singles on 40' lots and almost wholly occupies by Yugo-Slavs who have kept gardens, chickens and some livestock (horses and cows) even today. This area includes a Slovenian Nat'l Home and has its own parish (St. Christine's) and school on E. 222nd. The majority of the central part of this area is undeveloped which accounts for the ratio of 40% built up. Community has remained stable with little or no shift in population and should continue to remain the same for the next several years. Stores are located on E. 200th and E. 222nd and on Miller Ave.; transportation via St. Clair (Cleveland Rwy. - 20 min. service) and via E. 200th (Euclid city bus - 1/2 hr. service) are advantageous to this workingman's neighborhood. Two colored families are located on E. 209th (moved here recently). However no continued movement of colored into this section is expected because of the antagonistic feeling of Yugo-Slav residents for these people. Employment is within walking distance to South (Chase Brass Co. & Addressograph - Multigraph Co.)
Laborers - factory workers This cheap neighborhood was laid out about 25 yrs. ago into lots ranging 25-40' frontage; developed without deed restrictions, and now built up about 50% with properties lacking uniformity, containing a mixture of small 1 sty. homes, 1 1/2 sty. semi-bungalows, 2 sty. box-type frame, semi-commercial structures and a few large two-families. Developers of this section, Chas. M. Mix and Moses Helper catered primarily to foreign and area has become largely an Italian section mixed with a few Yugo-Slav. families and about 3 colored families. A few properties in area are fairly well kept and range in value from $5500-6000 but they are the exception and constitute over-developments in this neighborhood. This area has a fairly good rental demand because it is the second cheapest neighborhood in Euclid and its proximity to transportation on E. 200th (western boundary) plus the nearness of the desirable Lake Shore Blvd. district has held its popularity for the low income class. Because of its undesirabillity and lack of conformity to other Euclid neighborhood, the abutting territory to the north, west and south remains entirely undeveloped; also Wilmore and Morris in this area are largely undeveloped. Schools, stores and churches are within convenient walking distance. Within the last 10 yrs. a gradual shifting of population in this section has been occurring constituted by the clow moving-out of Italian families who lost their homes and replacement by American families of foreign descent. However, the general character of neighborhood with its small gardens, chicken coops and limited livestock (goats and cows) only strengthens the establishment of this neighborhood as a 4th grade area. (Small extreme southwestern projection includes 3 colored families on Merideth Ave.
Laborers- factory workers- railroaders  This area is comprised of a long narrow strip which is located along the C.C.C. & St. L. RR (running in a northeasterly direction) and extends all the way from Firsey St., south, to W. 37th, north. The area is 80% built up; 75% of the streets are paved (mostly in the northern and central sections); fairly good transportation, school and shopping facilities. That section of area lying between West Blvd. north to W. 73rd is an old German community; homes here are in fair to good condition and the home ownership ratio approximates 80%. This is by far the best part of the area. The section from W. 73rd north is a Hungarian settlement; the homes in this section range all the way from 25-60 yrs. and are in fair condition. That section of area lying south of West Blvd. is a colored settlement, solidly occupied in that part situated between Jasper and W. 120th. The southern portion lying south of Brookfield is only sparsely built up and utilities are available only in a limited way. It is only fair to assume that this area will widen and affect the adjacent properties in the abutting 3rd grade area. The foreign-born people continue to come into this section at a slow but steady pace as the better native American people emigrate in about the same ratio. Some Negroes area also trickling into the southern part of area. Proximity to industry, railroad yards and Public Square will, undoubtedly, uphold the area's present level for a few years at least.
Factory workers and laborers This small area, located in the southeastern section of Lakewood, Ohio, and hemmed in by Madison Park on the northwest and by industry and industrial sites on the southern and eastern boundaries, comprises the earlies foreign (Slavish-Polish) settlement here. It was settled, principally, by workers employed by the National Carbon Co. (located immediately east of area's boundary) who wanted to be conveniently located to their employment. Homes in area average 40-50 yrs.; most of these have been large single dwellings at one time but have since been converted into 2-3 family units. There are several much older homes, a few of which are ripe for demolition. On the other hand, there is still some evidence of good home maintenance. However, as a whole, the area is rapidly on the down grade. About 2 to 3 vacant store rooms are found on each street. Several homes are covered with brick-patent sliding, especially on Robin Ave.; Plover Ave. has the poorest streets in this small foreign community. Being close to Cleveland's Public Square, the area has adequate transportation and school facilities. The old residents remain intact, however, the younger generation is moving to better neighborhood farther west. The area will remain static and any noticeable increase in vacancy ratio will take place only as the old settlers pass on.
Laborers- WPA workers- relief clients This area situated in the extreme northeast corner of Cleveland's west side, is one of the city's oldest residential neighborhoods. Originally settled by Germans and Irish, it slowly bowed to Cleveland's expansion and infiltration of other foreign peoples. Roumanians, Hungarians and Italians migrated here about 30 yrs. ago and now comprise the predominating population elements. The Roumanians settles around W. 48th St. district-- the Hungarian and Italian people located between W. 54th and W. 73rd Sts., (largely north of Detroit Ave.) Several old German families are still found along the eastern and central part of the area. The earliest developments of this area was along W. 28th and W. 29th Sts. and here many of the homes are 75 to 80 yrs. old; now fully developed, the area was built up with large 2 sty. single dwellings, many of which were converted into 2-3 family units and rooming houses; (there are a few 1 1/2 sty. homes on each street interspersed with the large converted type). The houses along W. 58th St. and west thereof are in better repair condition--are more modern--have full basements and average 25-30 yrs. Franklin Ave. was once the fashionable district of the west side; two family homes (with round basements) on this street sell for around $3500-$5500 singles and doubles without basements or round cellars from $1800-3500. The main business section of west-side Cleveland is located here; retail business shops run solidly along Lorain, Detroit, Fulton and W. 25th St. There was a small colored settlement in the northeast peak of this area but there homes were razed for the new Main Ave. bridge and also for the Slum Clearance Project. Proximity to Public Square and to industry and because of convenience to transportation, schools, stores, churches, etc. this area will remain attractive to present type of occupants. Transition is to retail stores, light manufacturing establishments and rooming houses.
Factory workers- Laborers- Some Merchants This very old 4th grade area, once the "Bon-Ton" neighborhood on the "west side" lies immediately west of the Cuyahoga River and south of Lorain Ave.; the northern and eastern boundaries extend to a cliff which overlook the Cuyahoga River Valley, Originally settled by Germans and occupied by them up to 35-40 yrs. ago, the area saw an influx of Russian, Slovak and Polish people with a lighter infiltration of Syrians and Greeks in later years. The old residents moved to Lakewood, Rocky River and Bay Village. The area was developed generally with large single homes on 20-40' lots with a few 50' in width on Kenilworth Ave. The industrial and commercial expansion of the "west side" was keenly felt by this area. Now bordered by railroads, factories and steel mills on the north and east boundaries and traversed by 3 main heavy trafficked arteries (W. 25th-Scranton-W. 14th St.) this once fashionable and peaceful residential community rapidly gave ground to its inescapable transition. The fair residential parts or what is left of them lie in the southwest corner (west of W. 25th St.) and along Kenilworth in the north part of area; the poorest sections, along the eastern boundary. The large single homes are generally located on Scranton, W. 14th St., Kenilworth and Starkweather. Briefly, the area consists of: 40% large and small single homes, 40% two-family type (90% of which were converted doubles) and 20% three or more family unit dwellings; the latter type is crowded with two homes on one lot--5 homes on 3 lots, etc. Such streets as Vega, Jennings, Scranton, Walton and Seymour were once the area's most fashionable districts. Retail business-stores run solid on W. 25th and very heavy on Scranton and W. 14th Cleveland's Municipal Hospital (largest city hospital in country) is located on Scranton. One of Cleveland's five Govt. Slum Clearance Projects (500 families) is situated in eastern section of area. The Jennings Rd. Project (WPA) when completed, will relieve the heavy traffic congestion on W. 25th St. The area has a 10% vacancy with many uninhabitable units especially in the north-eastern section; vandalism prevails most strongly here. Rental collections are difficult and WPA and Relief Rolls are very heavy. Despite its undesirability, present type of occupants are not scarce in Cleveland and area's characteristics in the main will remain constant for several years.
Laborers (heavy relief) This small area, virtually all negro neighborhood of shacks and small homes, was the result of a movement of colored laborers to this section about 25 yrs. ago in the hope of securing employment with the Best Foundry and American Stove Co. in Bedford. Realtor's opinion is that this neighborhood was originally formed on a "squatter's rights" basis, later settled by claim and deed conveyance for small sums so that most properties are actually owned. Population of this neighborhood is about 50 colored families and some 7 or 8 Italian families within border. Occupancy is full and, although little rental information is available, it is thought that any tenancy is on some future sales arrangement. The City of Bedford has no interest in, and will not annex, this little community known as "Lincoln Heights" for its relief rolls are heavy and area is unpaved and lacks all utility facilities except electricity in some parts. It was also stated that most residents in this neighborhood are employed in Cleveland and not in Bedford. Because of its cheapness (even to colored) and distance from Cleveland (employment source) it is not believed this colored community will expand and probably will decrease within the next few years with the rise in number of uninhabitable units.
Laborers - factory workers This area is flat; unwooded - was developed about 35-40 years ago and colored infiltration came within a year after the first few homes were built. The streets are unpaved but all utilities are in. The section is sprinkled with shacks and the whole neighborhood presents a more or less shoddy appearance. The neighborhood, however, is law abiding and gives no trouble to the law enforcement bureau. About two years ago strong effort began to decrease the colored occupancy of this area and has resulted in the moving of 23 families (only 50 remaining) some of whom were moved at the city's expense. In each case the removal of a colored family caused the occupancy of a white family in this neighborhood. There is also a tendency towards improvement in the physical appearance of the community during this same period. Longwood is entirely owned by white -- Sterling has not been opened.
Laborers - factory workers This area is the least desirable neighborhood in Garfield Heights. Immediate proximity to negro settlement abutting north boundary -- absence of transportation -- lack of sewers -- unpaved streets and general isolation all have taken their toll. This community was developed about 20-25 years ago and then stopped with the influx of negroes into abutting area. At present, property can be sold only at sacrifice and mortgage money is not available which indicates that potentially this neighborhood will eventually be taken over by negroes with improvement in their financial condition. Approximately 30 homes are located in this area; developed about 40%; no further development is anticipated for white ownership.
